0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Energetic and concrete action has been taken in Colombia during the past 60 days against the mafiosi of the drug trade, but it has not been sufficiently effective, because, unfortunately, it came too late.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Ten years ago, the newspaper El Espectador, of which my brother Guillermo was editor, began warning of the rise of the drug mafias and of their leaders' aspirations to control Colombian politics, especially the Congress.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Then, when it would have been easier to resist them, nothing was done and my brother was murdered by the drug mafias three years ago.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> The most ruthless dictatorships have not censored their press more brutally than the drug mafias censor Colombia's.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> The censorship is enforced through terrorism and assassination.
5 <TAB> 8 <TAB> In the past 10 years about 50 journalists have been silenced forever, murdered.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Within the past two months a bomb exploded in the offices of the El Espectador in Bogota, destroying a major part of its installations and equipment.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And only last week the newspaper Vanguardia Liberal in the city of Bucaramanga was bombed, and its installations destroyed.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Journalists and their families are constantly threatened as are the newspaper distribution outlets.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Distribution centers are bombed, and advertisers are intimidated.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Censorship is imposed by terrorism.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> If the Colombian media accept this new and hideous censorship there is little doubt that the drug mafia's terrorism someday will extend to all the newspapers published in the free world.
12 <TAB> 16 <TAB> The solidarity of the uncensored media world-wide against drug terrorism is the only way press freedom can survive.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> The American people and their government also woke up too late to the menace drugs posed to the moral structure of their country.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Even now, the American attack upon this tremendous problem is timid in relation to the magnitude of the threat.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> I can attest that a recent Colombian visitor to the U.S. was offered drugs three times in the few blocks' walk between Grand Central Terminal and the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in midtown Manhattan.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Colombia alone -- its government, its people, its newspapers -- does not have the capacity to fight this battle successfully.
17 <TAB> 19 <TAB> All drug-consuming countries must jointly decide to combat and punish the consumers and distributors of drugs.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The U.S., as the major drug consumer, should lead this joint effort.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Reduction, if not the total cessation, of drug consumption is the requirement for victory.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Much is being done in Colombia to fight the drug cartel mafia.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Luxurious homes and ranches have been raided by the military authorities, and sophisticated and powerful communications equipment have been seized.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> More than 300 planes and helicopters have been impounded at airports, and a large number of vehicles and launches has been confiscated.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> The military has also captured enormous arsenals of powerful and sophisticated weapons, explosives and other war-like materiel.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Much has been accomplished and public opinion decisively supports the government and the army -- but, on the other hand, none of the key drug barons have been captured.
25 <TAB> 27 <TAB> There has been a lot of talk that a large portion of the Colombian economy is sustained by the laundering of drug money.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In my opinion, this is not true.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Laundered drug money has served only to increase, unrealistically, the price of real estate, creating serious problems for low-income people who aspire to own their own homes.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> Drug money has also gone to buy expensive cars, airplanes, launches and nightclubs where drugs are consumed.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But most of the drug money is kept in investments and in financial institutions outside Colombia.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In fact, the cooperation of those financial institutions is essential to the success of the drug battle.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> What is of much more importance to the Colombian economy than the supposed benefits of laundered drug money is higher prices for Colombia 's legitimate products.
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> The price of coffee has gone down almost 45% since the beginning of the year, to the lowest level (after inflation) since the Great Depression.
33 <TAB> 35 <TAB> Market conditions point to even lower prices next year.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The 27-year-old coffee cartel had to be formally dissolved this summer.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> As a result, Colombia will earn $500 million less from its coffee this year than last.
36 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Our coffee growers face reductions in their income, and this tempts them to contemplate substituting coca crops for coffee.
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> U.S. interests occasionally try to impose barriers to the import of another important Colombian export -- cut flowers -- into the American market.
38 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A just price and an open market for what Colombian produces and exports should be the policy of the U.S.
39 <TAB> -1 <TAB> I take advantage of this opportunity given to me by The Wall Street Journal to make a plea to the millions of readers of this newspaper, to become soldiers dedicated to the fight against the use of drugs.
40 <TAB> 41 <TAB> Each gram of cocaine consumed is a deadly bullet against those in our country and in the rest of the world who fight this terrible scourge.
41 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A crusade of NO to the consumption of drugs is imperative.

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Nothing was going to hold up the long-delayed settlement of Britton vs. Thomasini.
1 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Not even an earthquake.
2 <TAB> 5 <TAB> On the afternoon of Oct. 17, after hours of haggling with five insurance-claims adjusters over settling a toxic-waste suit, four lawyers had an agreement in hand.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> But as Judge Thomas M. Jenkins donned his robes so he could give final approval, the major earthquake struck, its epicenter not far from his courtroom in Redwood City, Calif.
4 <TAB> 9 <TAB> The walls shook; the building rocked.
5 <TAB> 12 <TAB> For a while, it looked like the deal -- not to mention the courtroom itself -- was on the verge of collapse.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "The judge came out and said, `Quick, let's put this on the record,'" says Sandy Bettencourt, the judge's court reporter.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "I said, `NOW?' I was shaking the whole time."
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A 10-gallon water cooler had toppled onto the floor, soaking the red carpeting.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Lights flickered on and off; plaster dropped from the ceiling, the walls still shook and an evacuation alarm blared outside.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> The four lawyers climbed out from under a table.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "Let's close the door," said the judge as he climbed to his bench.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> At stake was an $80,000 settlement involving who should pay what share of cleanup costs at the site of a former gas station, where underground fuel tanks had leaked and contaminated the soil.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And the lawyers were just as eager as the judge to wrap it up.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "We were never going to get these insurance companies to agree again," says John V. Trump, a San Francisco defense lawyer in the case.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Indeed, the insurance adjusters had already bolted out of the courtroom.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The lawyers went to work anyway, duly noting that the proceeding was taking place during a major earthquake.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Ten minutes later, it was done.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For the record, Jeffrey Kaufman, an attorney for Fireman's Fund, said he was "rattled -- both literally and figuratively."
19 <TAB> 22 <TAB> "My belief is always, if you've got a settlement, you read it into the record," says Judge Jenkins, now known in his courthouse as "Shake'Em Down Jenkins."
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The insurance adjusters think differently.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "I didn't know if it was World War III or what," says Melanie Carvain of Morristown, N.J.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "Reading the settlement into the record was the last thing on my mind."

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Toni Johnson pulls a tape measure across the front of what was once a stately Victorian home.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> A deep trench now runs along its north wall, exposed when the house lurched two feet off its foundation during last week's earthquake.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> A side porch was ripped away.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> The chimney is a pile of bricks on the front lawn.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The remainder of the house leans precariously against a sturdy oak tree.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> The petite, 29-year-old Ms. Johnson, dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt as she slogs through the steady afternoon rain, is a claims adjuster with Aetna Life &amp; Casualty.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> She has been on the move almost incessantly since last Thursday, when an army of adjusters, employed by major insurers, invaded the San Francisco area to help policyholders sift through the rubble and restore some order to their lives.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Equipped with cellular telephones, laptop computers, calculators and a pack of blank checks, they parcel out money so their clients can find temporary living quarters, buy food, replace lost clothing, repair broken water heaters, and replaster walls.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Some of the funds will used to demolish unstable buildings and clear sites for future construction.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Many adjusters are authorized to write checks for amounts up to $100,000 on the spot.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They don't flinch at writing them.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "That's my job -- get {policyholders} what they're entitled to," says Bill Schaeffer, a claims supervisor who flew in from Aetna 's Bridgeport, Conn., office.
12 <TAB> 14 <TAB> The Victorian house that Ms. Johnson is inspecting has been deemed unsafe by town officials.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But she asks a workman toting the bricks from the lawn to give her a boost through an open first-floor window.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Once inside, she spends nearly four hours measuring and diagramming each room in the 80-year-old house, gathering enough information to estimate what it would cost to rebuild it.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> She snaps photos of the buckled floors and the plaster that has fallen away from the walls.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> While she works inside, a tenant returns with several friends to collect furniture and clothing.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> One of the friends sweeps broken dishes and shattered glass from a countertop and starts to pack what can be salvaged from the kitchen.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Others grab books, records, photo albums, sofas and chairs, working frantically in the fear that an aftershock will jolt the house again.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> The owners, William and Margie Hammack, are luckier than many others.
20 <TAB> 22 <TAB> A few years ago, Mrs. Hammack insisted on buying earthquake insurance for this house, which had been converted into apartments.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Only about 20% of California home and business owners carried earthquake coverage.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Hammacks' own home, also in Los Gatos, suffered comparatively minor damage.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Ms. Johnson, who works out of Aetna's office in Walnut Creek, an East Bay suburb, is awed by the earthquake's destructive force.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "It really brings you down to a human level," she says.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "It's hard to accept all the suffering people are going through, but you have to.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If you don't, you can't do your job."
27 <TAB> 31 <TAB> For Aetna and other insurers, the San Francisco earthquake hit when resources in the field already were stretched.
28 <TAB> 30 <TAB> Most companies still are trying to sort through the wreckage caused by Hurricane Hugo in the Carolinas last month.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Aetna, which has nearly 3,000 adjusters, had deployed about 750 of them in Charlotte, Columbia, and Charleston.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Adjusters who had been working on the East Coast say the insurer will still be processing claims from that storm through December.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> It could take six to nine months to handle the earthquake-related claims.
32 <TAB> 34 <TAB> When the earthquake rocked northern California last week, Aetna senior claims executives from the San Francisco area were at the company 's Hartford, Conn., headquarters for additional training on how to handle major catastrophes, including earthquakes.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Since commercial airline flights were disrupted, the company chartered three planes to fly these executives back to the West Coast and bring along portable computers, cellular phones and some claims adjusters.
34 <TAB> 35 <TAB> Because of the difficulty of assessing the damages caused by the earthquake, Aetna pulled together a team of its most experienced claims adjusters from around the country.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Even so, few had ever dealt with an earthquake.
36 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Some adjusters, like Alan Singer of San Diego, had been working in Charleston for nearly four weeks.
37 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He returned home last Thursday, packed a bag with fresh clothes and reported for duty Friday in Walnut Creek.
38 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Offices were set up in San Francisco and San Jose.
39 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In a few instances, Aetna knew it would probably be shelling out big bucks, even before a client called or faxed in a claim.
40 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For example, officials at Walnut Creek office learned that the Amfac Hotel near the San Francisco airport, which is insured by Aetna, was badly damaged when they saw it on network television news.
41 <TAB> 42 <TAB> "The secret to being a good adjuster is counting," says Gerardo Rodriguez, an Aetna adjuster from Santa Ana.
42 <TAB> 43 <TAB> "You have to count everything."
43 <TAB> 44 <TAB> Adjusters must count the number of bathrooms, balconies, fireplaces, chimneys, microwaves and dishwashers.
44 <TAB> 45 <TAB> But they must also assign a price to each of these items as well as to floors, wallcoverings, roofing and siding, to come up with a total value for a house.
45 <TAB> -1 <TAB> To do that, they must think in terms of sheetrock by the square foot, carpeting by the square yard, wallpaper by the roll, molding by the linear foot.
46 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Using a calculator and a unit-price guide for such jobs as painting, plumbing and roofing in each major region of the country, adjusters can figure out the value of a home in today's market and what it would cost to rebuild it.
47 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Sometimes repairs are out of the question.
48 <TAB> 49 <TAB> When Aetna adjuster Bill Schaeffer visited a retired couple in Oakland last Thursday, he found them living in a mobile home parked in front of their yard.
49 <TAB> 50 <TAB> The house itself, located about 50 yards from the collapsed section of double-decker highway Interstate 880, was pushed about four feet off its foundation  and then collapsed into its basement.
50 <TAB> 51 <TAB> The next day, Mr. Schaeffer presented the couple with a check for $151,000 to help them build a new home in the same neighborhood.
51 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He also is working with a real-estate agent to help find them an apartment to rent while their home is being built.
52 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Many of the adjusters employed by Aetna and other insurers have some experience with construction work or carpentry.
53 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But such skills were alien to Toni Johnson.
54 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Four years ago, she was managing a film-processing shop and was totally bored.
55 <TAB> 56 <TAB> A friend mentioned that she might want to look into a position at Aetna, if she was interested in a job that would constantly challenge her.
56 <TAB> 57 <TAB> She signed up, starting as an "inside" adjuster, who settles minor claims and does a lot of work by phone.
57 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A year later, she moved to the commercial property claims division.
58 <TAB> 59 <TAB> She spent a month at an Aetna school in Gettysburg, Pa., learning all about the construction trade, including masonry, plumbing and electrical wiring.
59 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That was followed by three months at the Aetna Institute in Hartford, where she was immersed in learning how to read and interpret policies.
60 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Her new line of work has some perils.
61 <TAB> 62 <TAB> Recently, a contractor saved her from falling three stories as she investigated what remained of an old Victorian house torched by an arsonist.
62 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "I owe that contractor.
63 <TAB> -1 <TAB> I really do," she says.
64 <TAB> 65 <TAB> As Ms. Johnson stands outside the Hammack house after winding up her chores there, the house begins to creak and sway.
65 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The ground shakes underneath her.
66 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It is an aftershock, one of about 2,000 since the earthquake, and it makes her uneasy.
67 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The next day, as she prepares a $10,000 check for the Hammacks, which will cover the cost of demolishing the house and clearing away the debris, she jumps at the slightest noise.
68 <TAB> -1 <TAB> On further reflection, she admits that venturing inside the Hammacks ' house the previous day wasn't" such a great idea."
69 <TAB> -1 <TAB> During her second meeting with the Hammacks, Ms. Johnson reviews exactly what their policy covers.
70 <TAB> 71 <TAB> They would like to retrieve some appliances on the second floor, but wonder if it's safe to venture inside.
71 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Ms. Johnson tells them that, if the appliances can't be salvaged, their policy covers the replacement cost.
72 <TAB> 76 <TAB> Mr. Hammack is eager to know what Aetna will pay for the house, which has to come down.
73 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "When will I get that check for a million dollars ?" he jokes.
74 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The adjuster hadn't completed all the calculations, but says : "We 're talking policy limits."
75 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In this case, that's about $250,000.
76 <TAB> 77 <TAB> It suddenly dawns on Mr. Hammack that rebuilding the house in Los Gatos, an affluent community in Santa Clara County, may cost more than Aetna's policy will pay.
77 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "We can lose money on this," he says.
78 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "And you didn't want me to buy earthquake insurance," says Mrs. Hammack, reaching across the table and gently tapping his hand.
79 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Earthquake insurance costs about $to $ annually for every $1,000 of value, and high deductibles mean it generally pays only when there is a catastrophe.
80 <TAB> 81 <TAB> So, many Californians believe they can get by without it.
81 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Even Ms. Johnson herself made that assumption.
82 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "I always knew that the ` Big One ' was coming, but not during my lifetime," she says.
83 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Now she says she's thinking of contacting her own insurance agent.
84 <TAB> 85 <TAB> For Ms. Johnson, dealing with the earthquake has been more than just a work experience.
85 <TAB> -1 <TAB> She lives in Oakland, a community hit hard by the earthquake.
86 <TAB> -1 <TAB> She didn't have hot water for five days.
87 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The apartment she shares with a 12-year-old daughter and her sister was rattled, books and crystal hit the floor, but nothing was severely damaged.
88 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Her sister, Cynthia, wishes Toni had a different job.
89 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "We worry about her out there," Cynthia says.
90 <TAB> 91 <TAB> Last Sunday, Ms. Johnson finally got a chance to water her plants, but stopped abruptly.
91 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "I realized I couldn't waste this water when there are people in Watsonville who don't have fresh water to drink."
92 <TAB> -1 <TAB> She hasn't played any music since the earthquake hit, out of respect for those who died on Interstate 880 where the roadway collapsed.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> The government is sharpening its newest weapon against white-collar defendants : the power to prevent them from paying their legal bills.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> And defense lawyers are warning that they won't stick around if they don't get paid.
2 <TAB> 4 <TAB> The issue has come to a boil in Newark, N.J., where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for Eddie Antar that if the founder and former chairman of Crazy Eddie Inc. is indicted, the government may move to seize the money that Mr. Antar is using to pay legal fees.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The warning by the U.S. attorney's office follows two decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court last June.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> In those cases, the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes, including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> If the government succeeds in seizing Mr. Antar's assets, he could be left without top-flight legal representation, because his attorneys are likely to quit, according to individuals familiar with the case.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A seizure also would make the case the largest -- and one of the first -- in which lawyers ' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "The people who suffer in the short run are defendants, but the people who suffer in the long run are all of the people, because there won't be a vigorous private bar to defend the Bill of Rights," says Gerald Lefcourt, a criminal defense attorney who says he has turned down a number of cases to avoid possible fee seizures.
8 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Mr. Antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in Newark, where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges.
9 <TAB> 23 <TAB> Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO, the government has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a defendant's assets before trial.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> According to individuals familiar with Mr. Antar's case, prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of Mr. Antar's attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure.
11 <TAB> 13 <TAB> In a letter, prosecutors told Mr. Antar's lawyers that because of the recent Supreme Court rulings, they could expect that any fees collected from Mr. Antar may be seized.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Prosecutors have told Mr. Antar's attorneys that they believe
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Mr. Antar's allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys derives from illegal activities.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Therefore, they said, the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they are paid.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Justin Feldman and Jack Arseneault, attorneys for Mr. Antar, both declined to comment on the matter.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In Newark, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said, "I don't think there's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney 's fees to drug cases."
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Alito said his office "just responded to an attorney's question about whether we would go after attorney's fees, and that is different from actually doing it, although we reserve that right."
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> Mr. Antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> In that suit, the SEC accused Mr. Antar of engaging in a "massive financial fraud" to overstate the earnings of Crazy Eddie, Edison, N.J., over a three-year period.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Through his lawyers, Mr. Antar has denied allegations in the SEC suit and in civil suits previously filed by shareholders against Mr. Antar and others.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> The SEC has alleged that Mr. Antar aimed to pump up the company 's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Antar, the SEC said, made more than $60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> The Justice Department has emphasized that the government's fee-forfeiture power is to be used sparingly.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> According to department policy, prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers ' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> Still, criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers ' fees.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They also worry that if the government applies asset-forfeiture laws broadly, the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid.

1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Separately, bankers representing the group trying to buy United 's parent UAL Corp. met with other banks about reviving that purchase at a lower price, possibly around $250 a share, or $ 5.65 billion.
2 <TAB> 5 <TAB> But a lower bid could face rejection by the UAL board.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> Mr. Trump, who vowed Wednesday to "go forward" with the bid, said he was dropping it `` in light of the recent change in market conditions."
4 <TAB> 9 <TAB> He said he might now sell his AMR stake, buy more shares, or make another offer at a lower price.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Manhattan real-estate developer acted after the UAL buyers failed to obtain financing for their earlier $300-a-share bid, which sparked a selling panic among analysts that snowballed into a 190-point drop Friday in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> News about UAL and AMR, whose shares never reopened after trading was halted Friday for the UAL announcement, sent both stocks nosediving in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> UAL tumbled $56.875 to $ 222.875 on volume of 2.3 million shares, and AMR declined by $22.125 to $ 76.50 as 4.7 million shares changed hands.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Together, the two stocks wreaked havoc among takeover stock traders, and caused a 7.3 % drop in the Dow Jones Transportation Average, second in size only to the stock-market crash of Oct. 19, 1987.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Some said Friday's market debacle had given Mr. Trump an excuse to bail out of an offer that showed signs of stalling even before problems emerged with the UAL deal.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> After reaching an intraday high of $107.50 the day Mr. Trump disclosed his bid Oct. 17, AMR's stock had retreated as low as $97.75 last week.
11 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Some takeover stock traders had been betting against Mr. Trump because he has a record of disclosing stakes in companies that are potential takeover targets, then selling at a profit without making a bid.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "He still hasn't proven his mettle as a big-league take-out artist," said airline analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
13 <TAB> 15 <TAB> "He's done this thing where he 'll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He's written this book, ` The Art of the Deal. ' Why doesn't he just follow through on one of these things ?"
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Trump withdrew his bid before the AMR board, which is due to meet tomorrow, ever formally considered it.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> AMR had weighed a wide range of possible responses, from flat rejection to recapitalizations and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees, a friendlier buyer such as Texas billionaire Robert Bass, or both.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> AMR had also sought to foil Mr. Trump in Congress by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the Transportation Department to reject airline buy-outs.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> Yesterday, Mr. Trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the UAL deal on Congress, saying it was rushing through a bill to protect AMR executives.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "I believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the UAL transaction, and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced this past Friday," Mr. Trump wrote members of Congress.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> AMR declined to comment, and Mr. Trump didn't respond to requests for interviews.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Mr. Trump never said how much AMR stock he had bought, only that his holdings were "substantial."
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> However, he only received federal clearance to buy more than $ 15 million of the stock on Sept. 20, when the price rose $3.00 a share to $78.50.

25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Trump promised last week to notify the market before selling any shares.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> AMR was trading at around $84 yesterday before his withdrawal announcement, then immediately fell to about $76.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Assuming that he paid a rough average price of $80 a share, and assuming he didn't sell before his announcement reached the market, Mr. Trump could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $76.50.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> Some analysts said AMR Chairman Robert Crandall might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation's largest airline with a defensive transaction, such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> However, other knowledgeable observers said they believed Mr. Crandall and the AMR board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> Some analysts said they believed Mr. Trump, whose towering ego had been viewed by some as a reason to believe he wouldn't back out, might come back with a lower bid.
31 <TAB> 33 <TAB> Ray Neidl of Dillon Read &amp; Co. said Mr. Trump "is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle. I 'm sure he still wants AMR."
32 <TAB> 35 <TAB> But others remained skeptical.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> "I was never sure Donald Trump really wanted to take AMR," said John Mattis, a bond analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. "What happened with United was a gracious way for him to bow out."
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Trump never obtained financing for his bid.

36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> Meanwhile, Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp., the two lead lenders on the UAL buy-out, met with other banks yesterday to determine if they would be willing to finance the buy-out at a lower price.
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> Officials familiar with the talks said Citicorp had discussed lowering the offer to $250 a share, but said that price was a talking point and that no decision has been made.
38 <TAB> 39 <TAB> At $250 a share, the group would have to borrow about $ 6.1 billion from banks.
39 <TAB> 40 <TAB> The first UAL deal unraveled after Citibank and Chase couldn't raise $7.2 billion.
40 <TAB> 41 <TAB> Citibank and Chase had agreed to commit $billion, and said they were "highly confident" of raising another $4.2 billion.
41 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Together, Citicorp and Chase received $million in fees to raise the rest of the financing.
42 <TAB> 43 <TAB> But other banks balked at the low interest rate and banking fees the UAL group was willing to pay them.
43 <TAB> 47 <TAB> Officials familiar with the bank talks said the UAL buy-out group -- UAL pilots, management, and British Airways PLC -- is now willing to pay higher bank fees and interest, but isn't likely to boost its $ 965 million equity contribution.
44 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next 48 hours despite the hopes of many traders.
45 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The group's advisers want to make certain they have firm bank commitments the second time around.
46 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Even if the buy-out group is able to obtain financing, the transaction still faces obstacles.
47 <TAB> 48 <TAB> UAL's board could reject the new price as too low, especially since there aren't any competing bids.
48 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis, whose $275-a-share offer was rejected by UAL's board, hasn't shown signs of pursuing a $300-a-share back-up bid he made last month.
49 <TAB> 50 <TAB> In addition, the coalition of labor and management, longtime enemies
50 <TAB> -1 <TAB> who joined forces only under the threat of Mr. Davis's bid, could break apart now.

52 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Union Chairman F.C. (Rick)
53 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Dubinsky faces the tough task of explaining why banks refused to finance a buy-out the members approved overwhelmingly last week.
54 <TAB> 55 <TAB> The pilot union is vowing to pursue an acquisition whatever the board decides.
55 <TAB> 57 <TAB> But if the board rejects a reduced bid and decides to explore other alternatives, it could transform what has been a harmonious process into an adversarial one.
56 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The pilots could play hardball by noting they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the airplanes.
57 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If they were to insist on a low bid of, say $200 a share, the board mightn't be able to obtain a higher offer from other bidders because banks might hesitate to finance a transaction the pilots oppose.
58 <TAB> 59 <TAB> Also, because UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL executives have joined the pilots' bid, the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders.
59 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning bidder.

13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Analysts said the additional liquidity should tend to reduce the federal funds rate.

4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> In a statement, Ralph S.

5 <TAB> 10 <TAB> David J. Lothson, an industry analyst for PaineWebber Group Inc., said Johnson & Johnson's results slightly exceeded his expectations for the third quarter.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Johnson & Johnson shares fell 37.5 cents to $54.625.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Mr. Larsen noted "substantial sales growth" for the recently introduced Acuvue disposable contact lens and Hismanal, a once-a-day antihistamine.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Eprex, used by dialysis patients who are anemic, and Prepulsid, a gastro-intestinal drug, did well overseas, he said.

10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> But domestic consumer sales slipped 1.2% for the quarter, to $490 million from $496 million.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The company cited softness in the retail health and beauty aids category, "as well as the intense competition in the company's sanitary protection product line." Overseas sales were stronger, principally because of a rebound in Brazil, where economic turmoil had hurt year-earlier results, Johnson & Johnson said.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Mr. Lothson of PaineWebber said the company's sales pace has been picking up largely because the effect of unfavorable exchange rates has been easing -- a pattern continuing this quarter.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> He cautioned, however, that a "tough tax-rate comparison" may slow the company's earnings growth for the current quarter.

15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> While the third period contained no major surprises, Mr. Lothson said, the results show how sensitive the multinationals can be to developments in a single country such as Brazil.

2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Financial Corp. purchased the bonds, the suit alleged, after Mr. Boesky and Drexel negotiated an agreement for Vagabond Hotels to purchase a 51% stake in the thrift for about $34 million.

1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> As a result, UAL's chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, pulled out of the buy-out effort to focus on running the company.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> The two developments put the acquisition attempt back to square one and leaves the airline with an array of unresolved matters, including an unsettled labor situation and a management scrambling to restore its damaged credibility.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The effort to create the nation's largest employee-owned company began unraveling Oct. 13 when the labor-management group was unable to obtain financing for its $300-a-share, $6.79 billion offer.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Just last week it suffered another major setback when British Airways PLC, the largest equity investor in the labor-management bid, withdrew its support.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Takeover stock traders, focusing on the company's intention to stay independent, took the announcement as bad news.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> UAL, which had risen $9.875 to $178.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group, reversed course and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the 5:09 p.m. EDT announcement.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Among the first trades reported by the securities firm of Jefferies & Co., which makes a market in UAL after the exchange is closed, were 10,000 shares at $170, 6,000 shares at $162, 2,500 at $162, and 10,000 at $158.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The rebound in UAL stock during regular trading hours Monday was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price 41% below its level before Oct. 13, the day the group announced the bank financing couldn't be obtained for the original deal.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Twelve of UAL's outside directors met at a five-hour meeting yesterday in Chicago to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out group for a revised bid.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> But the board said it wasn't interested for now.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> That proposal, valued at between $225 and $240 a share, would have transferred majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> The buy-out group had no firm financing for the plan.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And, with no other offers on the table, the board apparently felt no pressure to act on it.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> The directors signaled, however, that they would be willing to consider future offers or take some other action to maximize shareholder value, saying they would continue to explore "all strategic and financial alternatives."
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> But it was clear that for the time being, the board wants the company to return to normalcy.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The board said it concluded that "the welfare of the company, its shareholders, its employees and the broader public . . . can best be enhanced by continued development of UAL as a strong, viable, independent company."
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Mr. Wolf urged all employees to "now turn their full attention" to operating the airline.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> He also vowed to "make every effort to nurture . . . a constructive new relationship that has been forged with participating employee groups."
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But Mr. Wolf faces a monumental task in pulling the company back together again.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Labor problems top the list.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> For a brief time, the buy-out effort seemed to solve his problems with United's pilot union.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> In return for an ownership stake in the company, the pilots were willing to agree to a seven-year contract that included a no-strike clause and significant wage concessions and productivity gains the union previously resisted.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That contract was tied to the success of the buy-out.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> As a "good-will measure," the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly UAL's two new Boeing 747-400 aircraft.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It's uncertain if the pilots will continue to do so without a contract settlement.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> The union said late last night that it is still committed to majority employee ownership and that the labor disputes that faced the company prior to the buy-out effort "still need to be addressed."
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> The buy-out effort also worsened already-strained relations between United's pilot and machinist unions.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The machinists' criticisms of the labor-management bid and their threats of a strike unless they received substantial wage increases this year helped cool banks' interest in financing the transaction.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> The machinists previously had shown themselves to be an ally to Mr. Wolf, but he lost much of his credibility with that group when he teamed up with the pilot union.
30 <TAB> 33 <TAB> The machinists criticized the terms Mr. Wolf and management received in the buy-out.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They paid $15 million for a 1% stake and received an additional 9% of the company at no additional cost.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> His credibility is also on the line in the investment community.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> Until the collapse of this bid, Mr. Wolf was regarded as one of the nation's savviest airline executives after engineering turnarounds of Tiger International Inc. and Republic Airlines.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But he and his chief financial officer, John Pope, sowed some of the seeds for the deal's failure by insisting banks accept low financing fees and interest rates, while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the $114.3 million they stood to gain from sale of their UAL stock and options.
35 <TAB> 36 <TAB> The board's actions leave takeover stock traders nursing some $700 million in losses and eager to respond to anyone who might make a new offer.
36 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It also inevitably leaves a residue of shareholder lawsuits.
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> Arbitragers said they were disappointed the company didn't announce some recapitalization or other plan to maximize value.
38 <TAB> 39 <TAB> One takeover expert noted that arbitragers could force a recapitalization through the written consent process under which holders may oust the board by a majority vote.
39 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The machinists union has suggested it may propose a recapitalization that includes a special dividend for holders and a minority ownership stake for employees.
40 <TAB> 41 <TAB> Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis, whose $240-a-share offer for UAL in August triggered a bidding war, says he remains interested in the airline.
41 <TAB> 42 <TAB> However, he is restricted from making certain hostile moves by an agreement he signed to obtain confidential UAL data.
42 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Essentially, he can't make any hostile moves unless he makes a tender offer at least $300 a share.

1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> The results, which represented the fifth consecutive quarter of flat-to-lower earnings for the big electronics retailer, disappointed analysts and traders.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Tandy's stock fell $1.375 a share to close at $44 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
3 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Net for the quarter was $62.8 million, or 73 cents a share, down from $64.9 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The company said earnings would have increased if it hadn't been actively repurchasing its shares, thus increasing its interest expense and reducing its interest income.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Tandy had 86.3 million shares outstanding at Sept. 30, down from 90 million a year earlier.
6 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Revenue rose 5% to $986 million from $937 million.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Tandy said consumer electronics sales at its Radio Shack stores have been slow, partly because of a lack of hot, new products.
8 <TAB> 10 <TAB> "Radio Shack continues to be lackluster," said Dennis Telzrow, analyst with Eppler, Guerin & Turner in Dallas.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He said Tandy "has done a decent job" increasing sales by manufacturing computers for others and expanding sales of its Grid Systems Corp. subsidiary, which sells computers to bigger businesses, but "it's not enough to offset the problems at Radio Shack." Sales at Radio Shack stores open more than a year grew only 2% in the quarter from a year earlier, he said.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> As a result, Mr. Telzrow said he cut his fiscal 1990 per-share earnings estimate for Tandy to $4.05 from $4.20.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Japan has climbed up from the ashes of World War II and a gross national product of about $800 per capita to reach the heavyweight class among industrialized nations.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Now this remarkable economic growth seems to be coming to an end because the government has not converted itself into a modern, democratic, "developed nation" mode of operation.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Until 1980, when Japan joined the $10,000 per capita GNP club of the advanced countries, it was a model developing nation.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> The government built ports, bridges, highways, schools, hospitals and railways.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> When industries were weak, it protected them.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> It gave the Japanese people a value system, based on the rationalization that given the country's lack of natural resources, they must work hard to create value through exports and buy food with the surplus.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Individual prosperity inevitably would result.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> That system has worked.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The standard of living has increased steadily over the past 40 years; more than 90% of the people consider themselves middle class.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> The people have given their leading and only credible political party, the Liberal Democratic Party, clear and uninterrupted power for those 40 years.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> The LDP won by a landslide in the last election, in July 1986.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> But less than two years later, the LDP started to crumble, and dissent rose to unprecedented heights.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> The symptoms all point to one thing: Japan does not have a modern government.
13 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Its government still wants to sit in the driver's seat, set the speed, step on the gas, apply the brakes and steer, with 120 million people in the back seat.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> In a modern system, the government's role is to give the people as much choice as possible and to keep them well informed so they are capable of making a choice.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It also allows people to buy the best and the cheapest goods from anywhere in the world.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Japanese government doesn't allow this.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery actually is a ministry for farmers and fishermen instead of a ministry of provisions.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Ministry of Health and Welfare is a ministry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies rather than an organization dedicated to protecting the health of the people.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Ministry of Education is nothing but a cartel for licensed teachers, and certainly does not act on behalf of students.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Ministry of Construction spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that Japan's paved roadway per capita is the longest in the world, but they seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Ministry of Transportation serves the industry, certainly not the passengers who must pay extraordinarily high prices.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> And the Ministry of Foreign Affairs works for itself, supporting Japanese diplomats who sprinkle abundant aid money around the world to ensure that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host's.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> This ministry has done nothing to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions that are at the root of Japan's deteriorating image.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Instead, it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand its sphere of influence vis a vis other ministries.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> All this illustrates that Japanese ministries still have a "provider" mentality; they do not serve the people, and particularly not consumers.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> They serve the industries and the special-interest groups.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> The rest of the world accepted such methods when Japan was developing.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Japanese put up with it because the government provided job stability and growing paychecks.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> Japan is not a political country.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> It is a bureaucratic country.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> The Diet plays a minor role compared with the powerful bureaucratic system.
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> Most bills are drafted by bureaucrats, not politicians.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> The Diet doesn't normally even debate bills because the opposition parties are so often opposed to whatever LDP does that it would be a waste of time.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> So most bills are passed without full discussion; particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties.
35 <TAB> 36 <TAB> A recent example is the 3% consumption tax on all commercial activities.
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> This makes enormous sense in Japan, where direct tax accounts for more than 70% of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair.
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> If you are a salaried man, Amen! 100% captured.
38 <TAB> 39 <TAB> If you are a retailer, 50%, and a farmer, 30%.
39 <TAB> 40 <TAB> To correct this inequality, most people would have favored an indirect tax, like the consumption tax.
40 <TAB> 42 <TAB> But the bill was passed without debate in the Diet, in the absence of the opposition.
41 <TAB> -1 <TAB> As a result, the Japanese people didn't know what to expect when the new law was introduced on April 1.
42 <TAB> 43 <TAB> They were frustrated by the longer queues at the cashier and the small coins given as change.
43 <TAB> 44 <TAB> All of a sudden, prices were no longer in denominations of 100 or 200.
44 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They were 103 or 206.
45 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Pockets exploded with one-yen coins.
46 <TAB> 49 <TAB> While people were jingling their change, the LDP politicians were caught in scandals.
47 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Money, such as in Recruit's political donations, and women, as in the cases of Prime Minister Sosuke Uno and Secretary General Tokuo Yamashita, seldom have caused political scandals in Japan.
48 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Whereas most men were a bit ambivalent about the sex scandals (though they were furious about Recruit), women were upset about both and surged to the polls.
49 <TAB> 50 <TAB> In the recent Upper House and Tokyo metropolitan congressional elections, in which the Socialist Party won a runaway victory, 60% of all women voted, as opposed to the usual 40%.
50 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It is difficult to analyze how much of their anger was due to Recruit, the sex scandals, or the one-yen coins in their purses, but they obviously were voting to punish the LDP.
51 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Taken by surprise, the Socialist Party is busy changing its doctrines.
52 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It's now OK to deal with the U.S., but not the Soviet Union.
53 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Nuclear power plants are acceptable.
54 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty can continue, sort of.
55 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And so on.
56 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Against the rapid cosmetic overhaul of the Socialist Party the LDP has been paralyzed.
57 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Now is the time to reform the government from a provider, developing-country vanguard role to that of a modern, industrialized nation in which consumers have the ultimate choice.
58 <TAB> 59 <TAB> If the LDP, as currently composed, can't make the transformation, then it should split into two parties.
59 <TAB> 60 <TAB> One party could stand for consumer interests, small government, free trade and globalism to put Japan clearly among the most developed and open countries.
60 <TAB> 61 <TAB> The other party could continue on the traditional track of the LDP, representing the manufacturers' preference for larger government, control, regulation and protectionism.
61 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The LDP must make a decision immediately; Lower House elections must take place before June.
62 <TAB> 63 <TAB> In the current mood of the Japanese people, journalists and even some industrialists, giving power to the Socialists might be good for the LDP, cleansing it of past sins.
63 <TAB> -1 <TAB> We must not forget, however, that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shocks in real-estate and financial markets.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> General Motors Corp., in a series of moves that angered union officials in the U.S. and Canada, has signaled that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess vehicle-making capacity.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> In announcements to workers late last week, GM effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants, and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> GM is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The company, currently using about 80% of its North American vehicle capacity, has vowed it will run at 100% of capacity by 1992.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Just a month ago, GM announced it would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood, Ga., the eighth U.S. assembly facility to close since 1987.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Now, GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> GM officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> The problem, however, is that GM's moves are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Against that backdrop, UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich, who recently became head of the union's GM department, issued a statement Friday blasting GM's "flagrant insensitivity" toward union members.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> The auto maker's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed "disarray" and an "inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information," Mr. Yokich said.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> GM officials told workers late last week of the following moves:
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Production of full-sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in Flint, Mich.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> That means two plants -- one in Scarborough, Ontario, and the other in Lordstown, Ohio -- probably will be shut down after the end of 1991.
15 <TAB> 17 <TAB> The shutdowns will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Robert White, Canadian Auto Workers union president, used the impending Scarborough shutdown to criticize the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement and its champion, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> But Canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate GM move that affects three U.S. car plants and one in Quebec.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Workers at plants in Van Nuys, Calif., Oklahoma City and Pontiac, Mich., were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> GM is studying whether it can build the new Camaro-Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese, Quebec, company and union officials said.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> That announcement left union officials in Van Nuys and Oklahoma City uncertain about their futures.
21 <TAB> 23 <TAB> The Van Nuys plant, which employs about 3,000 workers, doesn't have a product to build after 1993.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Jerry Shrieves, UAW local president, said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a "flex plant," which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> At the Oklahoma City plant, which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars, Steve Featherston, UAW local vice president, said the plant has no new product lined up, and "none of us knows" when the A-body cars will die.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He said he believes GM has plans to keep building A-body cars into the mid-1990s.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> At Pontiac, however, the Camaro-Firebird decision appears to erase UAW hopes that GM would reopen the shuttered assembly plant that last built the plastic-bodied, two-seater Pontiac Fiero model.
26 <TAB> 28 <TAB> The Fiero plant was viewed as a model of union-management cooperation at GM before slow sales of the Fiero forced the company to close the factory last year.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Union officials have taken a beating politically as a result.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Dissident UAW members have used the Fiero plant as a symbol of labor-management cooperation's failure.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Procter & Gamble Co., helped by a gain from a lawsuit settlement and continued growth overseas, posted a 38% rise in fiscal first-quarter net income.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Net for the quarter ended Sept. 30 climbed to $551 million, or $1.66 a share, from $400 million, or $1.18 a share, a year earlier.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Per-share figures have been adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split effective Oct. 20.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> Sales increased 6% to $5.58 billion from $5.27 billion.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Earnings at the consumer-products giant were boosted by a gain of $125 million, or about 25 cents a share, stemming from last month's settlement of litigation with three of P&G's competitors over patents on P&G's Duncan Hines cookies.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Excluding the gain, P&G's earnings were close to analysts' predictions of about $1.40 a share for the quarter.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Wall Street had expected a modest rise in the company's domestic sales and earnings, and more substantial increases in overseas results.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> One factor helping sales and earnings was a 3% price rise for most P&G products, except coffee, analysts said.
8 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Unit volume, or amount of products shipped, rose about 11% in the international segment, with P&G continuing to win market share in Japan's diaper and detergent markets.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Jay Freedman, analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Co., said P&G's Always sanitary napkin, sold under the Whisper name in Japan, has firmly established itself as a leading brand.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He figures P&G will expand its personal-care product line in Japan to "continue that momentum."
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> P&G's U.S. shipments were up just 1%, partly because the company decided to shift more promotions and sales for health and beauty products to the fiscal second quarter.
12 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Hugh Zurkuhlen, analyst with Salomon Bros., predicts the shift will mean P&G's sales growth in the second quarter will be "in the double digits."
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Also slowing growth in the U.S. were lackluster results for P&G's cooking oils, which had a strong year-earlier first quarter.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Last year's drought in the Midwest prompted retailers to stock up on oils ahead of anticipated price increases, boosting sales for Crisco and Puritan oils, analysts said.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For fiscal 1990, analysts expect P&G's sales to continue to grow, with earnings climbing between 15% and 20%.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Lynne Hyman, vice president of equity research for First Boston Corp., expects P&G to post net of about $4.20 a share, on a post-split basis. "But I'm recognizing there's a good chance they'll do a bit better than that," she says.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In fiscal 1989, P&G earned $3.56 a share, adjusted for the stock split.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> One big factor affecting the fiscal second half will be the new stewardship of Edwin L. Artzt, who becomes chairman and chief executive officer in January.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Because of his remarkable success turning around P&G's international operations, analysts have high hopes for his tenure. "If he does to the domestic operations what he did internationally," says Mr. Zurkuhlen, "this company will earn $6 or $7 a share in a few years."

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> President Bush insists it would be a great tool for curbing the budget deficit and slicing the lard out of government programs.
1 <TAB> 3 <TAB> He wants it now.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Not so fast, says Rep. Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, a fellow Republican. "I consider it one of the stupidest ideas of the 20th century," he says.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> It's the line-item veto, a procedure that would allow the president to kill individual items in a big spending bill passed by Congress without vetoing the entire bill.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Whatever one thinks of the idea, it's far more than the budgetary gimmick it may seem at first glance.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Rather, it's a device that could send shock waves through the president's entire relationship with Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress, fundamentally enhance the power of the presidency and transform the way the government does its business.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> President Bush badly wants a line-item veto and has long called for a law giving it to the president.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Now the White House is declaring that he might not rely on Congress -- which hasn't shown any willingness to surrender such authority -- to pass the line-item veto law he seeks.
8 <TAB> 10 <TAB> White House spokesmen last week said Mr. Bush is considering simply declaring that the Constitution gives him the power, exercising a line-item veto and inviting a court challenge to decide whether he has the right.
9 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Although that may sound like an arcane maneuver of little interest outside Washington, it would set off a political earthquake. "The ramifications are enormous," says Rep. Don Edwards, a California Democrat who is a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee. "It's a real face-to-face arm wrestling challenge to Congress."
10 <TAB> 13 <TAB> White House aides know it's a step that can't be taken lightly -- and for that reason, the president may back down from launching a test case this year.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Some senior advisers argue that with further fights over a capital-gains tax cut and a budget-reduction bill looming, Mr. Bush already has enough pending confrontations with Congress.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They prefer to put off the line-item veto until at least next year.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Still, Mr. Bush and some other aides are strongly drawn to the idea of trying out a line-item veto.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> The issue arose last week when Vice President Dan Quayle told an audience in Chicago that Mr. Bush was looking for a test case.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that Mr. Bush was interested in the idea, but cautioned that there wasn't a firm decision to try it.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Mr. Bush, former President Reagan and a host of conservative activists have been arguing that a line-item veto would go a long way in restoring discipline to the budget process.
17 <TAB> 19 <TAB> They maintain that a president needs the ability to surgically remove pork-barrel spending projects that are attached to big omnibus spending bills.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Those bills can't easily be vetoed in their entirety because they often are needed to keep the government operating.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Conservatives note that 43 governors have the line-item veto to use on state budgets.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> More provocatively, some conservative legal theorists have begun arguing that Mr. Bush doesn't need to wait for a law giving him the veto because the power already is implicit in the Constitution.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> They base their argument on a clause buried in Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution that states: "Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him or . . . disapproved by him. . . ."
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This clause, they argue, is designed to go beyond an earlier clause specifying that the president can veto a "bill," and is broad enough to allow him to strike out items and riders within bills.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.), for one, accepts this argument and earlier this year publicly urged Mr. Bush "to use the line-item veto and allow the courts to decide whether or not it is constitutional."
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> There's little doubt that such a move would be immediately challenged in court -- and that it would quickly make its way to the Supreme Court to be ultimately resolved. "It's a major issue, and they wouldn't want to leave it at a lower level," says Stephen Glazier, a New York attorney whose writings have been instrumental in pushing the idea that a president already has a line-item veto.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> Rep. Edwards, the California Democrat, is one who pledges that he would immediately challenge Mr. Bush in the courts, arguing a line-item veto would expand a president's powers far beyond anything the framers of the Constitution had in mind. "It puts this president in the legislative business," he declares. "That's not what our fathers had in mind."
26 <TAB> 28 <TAB> In addition to giving a president powers to rewrite spending bills meant to be written in Congress, Rep. Edwards argues, a line-item veto would allow the chief executive to blackmail lawmakers.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He notes that, as a lawmaker from the San Francisco area, he fights each year to preserve federal funds for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If a president had a line-item veto and wanted to force him to support a controversial foreign-policy initiative, Rep. Edwards says, the president could call and declare that he would single-handedly kill the BART funds unless the congressman "shapes up" on the foreign-policy issue.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Proponents maintain that a president would choose to use a line-item veto more judiciously than that.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> But there may be another problem with the device: Despite all the political angst it would cause, it mightn't be effective in cutting the deficit.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Big chunks of the government budget, like the entitlement programs of Social Security and Medicare, wouldn't be affected.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Governors have found that they have to use the device sparingly to maintain political comity.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And it isn't even clear that some pork-barrel projects can be hit with a line-item veto because they tend to be listed in informal conference reports accompanying spending bills rather than in the official bills themselves.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Still, proponents contend that the veto would have what Mr. Glazier calls an important "chilling effect" on all manner of appropriations bills.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Lawmakers, they say, would avoid putting many spending projects into legislation in the first place for fear of the embarrassment of having them singled out for a line-item veto later.
36 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Whatever the outcome of a test case, President Bush would have to move cautiously becase the very attempt would "antagonize not just Democrats but Republicans," says Louis Fisher, a scholar at the Congressional Research Service who specializes in executive-legislative relations.
37 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Republicans have as much interest as Democrats in "the way the system works," he notes.
38 <TAB> 39 <TAB> Indeed, although a majority of Republican lawmakers favor a line-item veto, some, ranging from liberal Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield to conservative Rep. Edwards are opposed.
39 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Rep. Edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person.
40 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Conservatives pushing for a line-item veto now, he notes, may regret it later: "Sometime, you're going to have a Democratic president again" who'll use his expanded powers against those very same conservatives.
41 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill."

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Texas Instruments Inc., once a pioneer in portable computer technology, today will make a bid to reassert itself in that business by unveiling three small personal computers.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The announcements are scheduled to be made in Temple, Texas, and include a so-called "notebook" PC that weighs less than seven pounds, has a built-in hard disk drive and is powered by Intel Corp. 's 286 microprocessor.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> That introduction comes only two weeks after Compaq Computer Corp., believing it had a lead of three to six months on competitors, introduced the first U.S. notebook computer with such features.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> Despite the inevitable comparison with Compaq, however, Texas Instruments' new notebook won't be a direct competitor.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> While Compaq sells its machines to businesses through computer retailers, Texas Instruments will be selling most of its machines to the industrial market and to value-added resellers and original-equipment manufacturers.
5 <TAB> 8 <TAB> The introductions also mark Texas Instruments' plunge back into a technology it has all but ignored for the past several years.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Although the Dallas-based computer giant introduced the first portable data terminal in 1971 -- a 38-pound monster -- and the world's first microprocessor-based portable in 1976, the only portable machines it has introduced since the first part of the decade have been "dumb" terminals with limited on-board processing ability.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It stopped selling a standard personal computer a while ago.
8 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Now that is about to change, as Texas Instruments begins marketing two 14-pound laptop PCs with 20 megabyte and 40 megabyte hard drives.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> The laptops are not revolutionary and, indeed, are tardy in a market first opened by GRiD Systems Corp., now a unit of Tandy Corp., almost two years ago.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But the notebook, with the more advanced microprocessor and hard disk, is more innovative.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Weighing 6.7 pounds with battery, the notebook measures 8.2 by 11.7 inches, has a 20-megabyte hard disk drive and boasts a backlit screen that is 22% larger than Compaq's.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Kidder, Peabody & Co. is trying to struggle back.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Only a few months ago, the 124-year-old securities firm seemed to be on the verge of a meltdown, racked by internal squabbles and defections.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Its relationship with parent General Electric Co. had been frayed since a big Kidder insider-trading scandal two years ago.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> Chief executives and presidents had come and gone.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Now, the firm says it's at a turning point.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> By the end of this year, 63-year-old Chairman Silas Cathcart -- the former chairman of Illinois Tool Works who was derided as a "tool-and-die man" when GE brought him in to clean up Kidder in 1987 -- retires to his Lake Forest, Ill., home, possibly to build a shopping mall on some land he owns. "I've done what I came to do" at Kidder, he says.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> And that means 42-year-old Michael Carpenter, president and chief executive since January, will for the first time take complete control of Kidder and try to make good on some grandiose plans.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Carpenter says he will return Kidder to prominence as a great investment bank.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Wall Street is understandably skeptical.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Through the first nine months of the year, Kidder ranks a distant 10th among underwriters of U.S. stocks and bonds, with a 2.8% market share, up slightly from 2.5% in the year-earlier period, according to Securities Data Co.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It's quite a fall from the early 1980s, when Kidder still was counted as an investment-banking powerhouse.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Gary S. Goldstein, president of the Whitney Group, an executive search firm, said: "I'd like to see (Kidder) succeed.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But they have to attract good senior bankers who can bring in the business from day one."
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> In 1988, Kidder eked out a $46 million profit, mainly because of severe cost cutting.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Its 1,400-member brokerage operation reported an estimated $5 million loss last year, although Kidder expects it to turn a profit this year.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> In fact, Kidder is a minor player in just about every business it does except computer-driven program trading; in that controversial business, only Morgan Stanley & Co. rivals Kidder.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But even that niche is under attack, as several Wall Street firms pulled back from program trading last week under pressure from big investors.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Mr. Carpenter, a former consulting-firm executive who has a love for "task forces," says he has done a "complete rethink" of Kidder in recent months.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> There have been a dizzying parade of studies of the firm's operations.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> More than 20 new managing directors and senior vice presidents have been hired since January.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The firm's brokerage force has been trimmed and its mergers-and-acquisitions staff increased to a record 55 people.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Mr. Carpenter says that when he assumes full control, Kidder will finally tap the resources of GE.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> One of GE's goals when it bought 80% of Kidder in 1986 was to take advantage of "syngeries" between Kidder and General Electric Capital Corp., GE's corporate-finance unit, which has $42 billion in assets.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> The leveraged buy-out group of GE Capital now reports to Mr. Carpenter.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> So far, instead of teaming up, GE Capital staffers and Kidder investment bankers have bickered.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> Yet, says Mr. Carpenter, "We've really started to exploit the synergy between GE Capital and Kidder Peabody." The units have worked on 37 investment banking deals this year, he says, though not all of them have panned out.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> "We've had a good relationship with GE, which is the first time you could say that -- uh, let me withdraw that.
27 <TAB> 31 <TAB> It's been a steadily improving relationship," says Mr. Carpenter.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> Still, without many actual deals to show off, Kidder is left to stress that it finally has "a team" in place, and that everyone works harder.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> A month ago, the firm started serving dinner at about 7:30 each night; about 50 to 60 of the 350 people in the investment banking operation have consistently been around that late. "We are working significantly longer and harder than has been the case in the past," says Scott C. Newquist, Kidder's head of investment banking since June.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Everywhere, Kidder stresses the "always working" theme.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A new in-house magazine, Kidder World -- which will focus on the firm's synergy strategy, says Mr. Carpenter -- confides that on weekends Mr. Newquist "often gets value-added ideas while flying his single-engine Cessna Centurion on the way to Nantucket."
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> The firm's new head of mergers and acquisitions under Mr. Newquist, B.J. Megargel, talks of the opportunity to "rebuild a franchise" at Kidder. "The Kidder name is one of only six or seven that every CEO recognizes as a viable alternative" when considering a merger deal, he says.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Now, according to a Kidder World story about Mr. Megargel, all the firm has to do is "position ourselves more in the deal flow."
34 <TAB> 35 <TAB> With investment banking as Kidder's "lead business," where do Kidder's 42-branch brokerage network and its 1,400 brokers fit in?
35 <TAB> 36 <TAB> Mr. Carpenter this month sold off Kidder's eight brokerage offices in Florida and Puerto Rico to Merrill Lynch & Co., refueling speculation that Kidder is getting out of the brokerage business entirely.
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> Mr. Carpenter denies the speculation.
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> To answer the brokerage question, Kidder, in typical fashion, completed a task-force study.
38 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The result: Kidder will focus on rich individual investors and small companies, much closer to the clientele of Goldman, Sachs & Co. than a serve-the-world firm like Merrill Lynch or Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Mr. Carpenter notes that these types of investors also are "sophisticated" enough not to complain about Kidder's aggressive use of program trading.
39 <TAB> -1 <TAB> As part of the upscale push, Kidder is putting brokers through a 20-week training course, turning them into "investment counselors" with knowledge of corporate finance.
40 <TAB> 41 <TAB> They will get "new and improved tools to sell, particularly to the affluent investor," says brokerage chief Charles V. Sheehan.
41 <TAB> 42 <TAB> Theoretically, the brokers will then be able to funnel "leads" on corporate finance opportunities to Kidder's investment bankers, possibly easing the longstanding tension between the two camps.

1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> What defeated General Aoun was not only the weight of the Syrian army.

3 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Like Lebanon, and however unfairly, Israel is regarded by the Arab world as a colonial aberration.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Benjamin Jacobson & Sons has been the New York Stock Exchange specialist firm in charge of trading stock in UAL Corp. and its predecessors since the early 1930s.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But the firm has never had a day like yesterday.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> At first UAL didn't open because of an order imbalance.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> When it did a half-hour into the session, it was priced at $150 a share, down more than $28 from Monday's close.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> It sank further to as low as $145, but a big rally developed in the last half hour, pushing the stock back up to close at $170, down just $8.375 from Monday.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In the process, 4.9 million shares traded, making UAL the second most active issue on the Big Board.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Munching pizza when they could and yelling until their voices gave out, the two Benjamin Jacobson specialists at the Big Board's UAL trading post yesterday presided over what can only be described as a financial free-for-all.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> "It was chaotic.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> But we like to call it 'controlled chaos, '" said 47-year-old Robert J. Jacobson Jr., grandson of the firm's founder.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> He manned the UAL post yesterday with Christopher Bates, 33, an energetic Long Islander who's a dead ringer for actor Nicolas Cage.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Who was doing all the selling? "Options traders, arbitrage traders -- everyone," said Mr. Bates, cooling down with a carton of apple juice after the close yesterday.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Added Mr. Jacobson, "There were some pretty bad losses in the stock."
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Big Board traders said a 200,000-share buy order at $150 a share entered by Bear, Stearns & Co., which was active in UAL stock all day, is what set off the UAL crowd in the late afternoon.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A subsequent rally in UAL helped the staggering stock market stage an astonishing recovery from an 80-point deficit to finish only slightly below Monday's close.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Both Jacobson traders, who had been hoping UAL trading would get back to normal, read the news about the unraveling of UAL takeover plans on the train into work yesterday morning.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The news told them it would be a while longer before UAL resumed trading like a regular airline stock after months of gyrations.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> When Mr. Jacobson walked into the office at 7:30 a.m. EDT, he announced: "OK, buckle up."
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Messrs.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> Jacobson and Bates walked on the Big Board floor at about 8:45 a.m. yesterday and immediately spotted trouble.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Already entered in the Big Board's computers and transmitted to their post were sell orders for 65,000 UAL shares.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> The UAL news had already caused a selling furor in the so-called third market, in which firms buy and sell stock away from the exchange floor.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> UAL, which closed on the Big Board Monday at $178.375 a share, traded in the third market afterward as low as $158 a share.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> There were rumors of $148-a-share trades.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> In the 45 minutes before the 9:30 opening bell, the Jacobson specialists kept getting sell orders, heavier than they imagined.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> And at 9:15, they posted a $135 to $155 "first indication," or the price range in which the stock would probably open.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> That range was quickly narrowed to $145 to $155, although traders surrounding the post were told that $148 to $150 would be the likely target.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> When UAL finally opened a half hour late, some 400,000 shares traded at $150.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> There was "selling pressure from everyone," said one trader.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This month's Friday-the-13th market plunge spurred by UAL news wasn't as bad for the Jacobson specialists as yesterday's action.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> On that earlier day, the stock's trading was halted at a critical time so the specialists could catch their breath.
30 <TAB> 33 <TAB> Not yesterday.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Jacobson, his gray hair flying, didn't wear out his red-white-and-blue sneakers, but he sweat so much he considered sending out for a new shirt.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Bates usually handles day-to-day UAL trading on his own.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> But yesterday, the heavy trading action eventually consumed not only Messrs.
34 <TAB> 35 <TAB> Jacobson and Bates but four other Jacobson partners, all doing their specialist-firm job of tugging buyers and sellers together and adjusting prices to accommodate the market.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> About 30 floor traders crammed near the UAL post most of the day, and probably hundreds more came and went -- a "seething mass," as one trader described it.
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> The 4.9 million-share volume flowing through the Jacobson specialist operation was about five times normal for the stock.
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> The heavy buying in the last half hour led the specialists to take special steps.
38 <TAB> 40 <TAB> The Bear Stearns order that marked the late-day turnaround caused a "massive buying effort" as UAL jumped $20 a share to $170 in the last half hour, said Mr. Bates.
39 <TAB> -1 <TAB> With 15 seconds of trading to go, Mr. Jacobson, with what voice he had left, announced to the trading mob: "We're going to trade one price on the bell." That meant no trading would occur in the final seconds, as a way of making sure that last-second orders aren't subjected to a sudden price swing that would upset customers.
40 <TAB> -1 <TAB> About 11,000 shares sold at $170 on the bell, representing about eight to 10 late orders, the specialists estimate.
41 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Big Board traders praised the Jacobson specialists for getting through yesterday without a trading halt.
42 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In Chicago, a UAL spokesman, "by way of policy," declined to comment on the company's stock or the specialists' performance.
43 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Leaving the exchange at about 5 p.m., the Jacobson specialists made no predictions about how trading might go today.
44 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Said Earl Ellis, a Jacobson partner who got involved in the UAL action, "It all starts all over again" today.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> At a private dinner Thursday, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. chief executive Frederick Joseph delivered a sobering message about the junk bond market to officials of Prudential Insurance Co. of America.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Mr. Joseph conceded the junk market was in disarray, according to people familiar with the discussion.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> He said Drexel -- the leading underwriter of high-risk junk bonds -- could no longer afford to sell any junk offerings if they might later become troubled because Drexel risked losing its highly lucrative junk franchise.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The dinner was a stark confirmation that 1989 is the worst year ever for the $200 billion junk market.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> And investors and traders alike say the current turmoil could take years to resolve.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Amid the market disorder, even Drexel, which has the widest and most loyal following of junk bond investors, is pulling in its horns.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market, Drexel has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults, withdrawn new offerings, redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once-devoted investors.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> For many money managers, the past four months have been humiliating. "This is the worst shakeout ever in the junk market, and it could take years before it's over," says Mark Bachmann, a senior vice president at Standard & Poor's Corp., a credit rating company.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In the third quarter, for example, junk bonds -- those with less than an investment-grade rating -- showed negative returns, the only major sector of the bond market to do so.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Since the end of last year, junk bonds have been outperformed by all categories of investment-grade bonds, including ultra-safe Treasury securities.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> The junk market, which mushroomed to $200 billion from less than $2 billion at the start of the decade, has been declining for months as issuers have stumbled under the weight of hefty interest payments.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> The fragile market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp., which created its U.S. retailing empire with more than $3 billion in junk financing.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdale's department store chain up for sale.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> At that point, the junk market went into a tailspin as buyers disappeared and investors tried to sell.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In an interview, Mr. Joseph says his dinner discussion with the Prudential executives acknowledged problems for junk. "What I thought I was saying is that the market is troubled but still viable and, appropriately enough, quite quality-conscious, which is not at all bad," he says. "Nobody's been perfect in their credit judgments the past couple years, and we're going to make sure our default rates are going to be in the acceptable parameters of the market."
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> What has jolted many junk buyers is the sudden realization that junk bonds cannot necessarily be bought and sold with the ease of common stocks and many investment-grade bonds.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Unlike the New York Stock Exchange, where buyers and sellers are quickly matched, the junk market, where risky corporate loans are traded, is sometimes closed for repairs.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> At closely held Deltec Securities Corp., junk bond money managers Amy K. Minella and Hannah H. Strasser say the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary malaise.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> In recent months, they say, there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market's traditional investors, while new buyers haven't materialized to replace them.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Wall Street securities firms, "the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market," have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses, Deltec said in a recent, grim report to customers.
20 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced "above-normal" redemptions by shareholders, Deltec said.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Investors, trying to raise cash, have sold "large liquid issues" such as RJR Holdings Corp. and Kroger Co.; declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market's distress.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And, Deltec said, buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation. "In fact, savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter," Deltec said.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Ms. Minella and Ms. Strasser say they are managing their junk portfolios defensively, building cash and selectively upgrading the overall quality.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> Meanwhile, Prudential, the nation's largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk bonds, has seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to $6.5 billion from $7 billion since August because of falling junk prices. "We certainly do have a lack of liquidity here, and it's something to be concerned about," says James A. Gregoire, a managing director. "I have no reason to think things will get worse, but this market has a knack for surprising us.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> This market teaches us to be humble."
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The junk market's "yield hogs are learning a real painful lesson," he says.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> Although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default, the market has downgraded many junk issues as if they were in trouble, says Stuart Reese, manager of Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. 's $17 billion investment-grade public bond portfolio. "But we think the risks are there for things getting a lot worse.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> And the risks aren't appropriate for us," he says.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The big insurer, unlike Prudential, owns only about $150 million of publicly sold junk bonds.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> The string of big junk bond defaults, which have been a major cause of the market's problems this year, probably will persist, some analysts say. "If anything, we're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined," says Paul Asquith, associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> Mr. Asquith, whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April, says this year's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings.
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34%.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> One indication of a growing number of junk defaults, Mr. Asquith says, is that about half of the $3 billion of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by S&P this year are junk bonds sold during the market's big issue years of 1984 through 1986.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> These bonds, now rated single-D, include junk offerings by AP Industries, Columbia Savings (Colorado), First Texas Savings Association, Gilbraltar Financial Corp., Integrated Resources Inc., Metropolitan Broadcasting Corp., Resorts International Inc., Southmark Corp. and Vyquest Inc.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "Obviously, we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us the market wasn't so risky," says Bradford Cornell, professor of finance at University of California's Anderson Graduate School of Management in Los Angeles.
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> Mr. Cornell has just completed a study that finds that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds.
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> Mr. Cornell says: "The junk market is no bonanza as Drexel claimed, but it also isn't a disaster as the doomsayers say."
38 <TAB> 39 <TAB> Despite the junk market's problems, Drexel continues to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond investors that its Wall Street rivals haven't found.
39 <TAB> 40 <TAB> During the past three weeks, for example, Drexel has sold $1.3 billion of new junk bonds for Turner Broadcasting Co., Uniroyal Chemical, Continental Air and Duff & Phelps.
40 <TAB> 41 <TAB> Still, the list of troubled Drexel bond offerings dwarfs that of any firm on Wall Street, as does its successful offerings.
41 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Troubled Drexel-underwritten issues include Resorts International, Braniff, Integrated Resources, SCI TV, Gillette Holdings, Western Electric and Southmark.
42 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "Quality junk bonds will continue to trade well," says Michael Holland, chairman of Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc. "But the deals that never should have been brought have now become nuclear waste."

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> When last we left him, FBI Agent Nick Mancuso had solved a murder mystery, unraveled a Washington political scandal, and racked up some pretty good ratings numbers in the miniseries "Favorite Son." What next for the crusty FBI agent with the heart of gold?
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A spinoff series, of course.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> There are plenty of worse inspirations for shows -- and most of them had already made the fall lineup: a nun raising some lovable orphans.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> A den mother raising some lovable teen models.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A bunch of tans and bathing suits posing as lovable lifeguards.
5 <TAB> 14 <TAB> In that context, Robert Loggia's riveting performance as the unlovable -- even crotchety -- veteran agent seems a better franchise for a series than most.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Week by week on "Mancuso FBI" (NBC, Fridays, 10 p.m. ET), he pokes around the crime styles of the rich, famous and powerful of the Washington scene -- a loose cannon on deck at the FBI.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Over the first few weeks, "Mancuso FBI" has sprung straight from the headlines, which is either a commendable stab at topicality, or a lack of imagination, or both.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> The opening show featured a secretary of defense designate accused of womanizing (a la John Tower).
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> When his secretary is found floating dead in the pol's pool, Mancuso is called in to investigate.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Last week, a young black girl claimed she had been raped by a white police officer (a la Tawana Brawley).
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In this week's show, there's an unsafe nuclear weaponsmaking facility (a la Rocky Flats).
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Along the way, we're introduced to the supporting cast: a blond bombshell secretary (Randi Brazen -- her real name, honest), a scheming young boss (Fredric Lehne), another blonde bombshell who's also an idealistic lawyer (Lindsay Frost), and a forensics expert (Charles Siebert).
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If all of this seems a little stale, it's redeemed in part by some tricky plot twists: The usual suspects are found to be guilty, then not guilty, then guilty -- but of a different crime. (In last week's rape case, for example, the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest, and the biggest villains are the politicians who exploit the case.) Most of all though, the show is redeemed by the character of Mancuso.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> What makes the veteran FBI man so endearing is his hard-bitten cynicism -- earned, we discover, when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in the 1960s.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He wasn't protecting the Freedom Marchers; he was tailing them as subversives.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This is not the "Mississippi Burning" scenario that thrills his young colleagues: "Kid, you've been reading Classic Comics too long," Mancuso says. "Back in 1964, the FBI had five black agents.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Three were chauffeurs for J. Edgar Hoover, and two cleaned his house."
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> At the core of Mr. Loggia's Mancuso is his world-weary truculence.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> He describes a reporter as "Miss First Amendment." He describes a drowned corpse as "Esther Williams." And when he's told "Try a little tenderness," he shoots back "I'm going home to try a little linguine."
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Yet for all his cynicism, he's at heart a closet idealist, a softy with a secret crush on truth, justice and the American Way.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He's the kind of guy who rescues trampled flags.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If "Mancuso FBI" has an intriguing central character, it also has a major flaw: It's wildly overwritten.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Executive Producers Steve Sohmer and Jeff Bleckner (and writer/producers Ken Solarz and Steve Bello) have revved this show up to the breaking point.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> To start, there's always a crisis -- and someone always worries, "What if the press gets a hold of this?" At least once an episode we see protestors marching around screaming slogans.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> At least once Mancuso's boss yells "In here -- now," and proceeds to dress his investigator down: "You are a dinosaur . . . a hangover in a $10 suit . . . One more word and you are out on a park bench, mister." Finally, of course, the boss gives in, but he's still yelling: "I find myself explaining anything to Teddy Kennedy, you'll be chasing stolen cars in Anchorage."
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In fact, throughout "Mancuso FBI," we don't get words or lines -- we get speeches.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Witnesses shout, scream, pontificate: ". . . a dream that the planet could be saved from itself and from the sadistic dumb creatures who try to tear down every decent man who raises his voice."
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> And Mancuso himself is investigating at the top of his lungs: "How the hell can you live with yourself?" he erupts at a politician. "You twist people's trust.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> You built your career on prejudice and hate.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> The scars will be here years after the polls close."
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> In each show, Mancuso gets to unleash similar harangues: "Where the hell are they gonna live when people like you turn the world into a big toxic waste dump?
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> You're the real criminal here . . . and what you did wasn't just a murder -- it was a crime against humanity."
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And, at least once a show, someone delivers the line "Get off that soapbox." Now that's advice the writers should take to heart.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They have a series with a good character, some interesting, even occasionally surprising plot lines, and they're ruining it.
35 <TAB> 36 <TAB> Why, when a key witness disappears, does Mancuso trash her apartment, tearing down drapes, smashing walls?
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> It's a bizarre and totally inappropriate reaction, all to add more pizzazz to a script that's already overdosing on pizzazz.
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> That's not plot.
38 <TAB> 39 <TAB> That's not character.
39 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That's hyperventilating.
40 <TAB> 41 <TAB> There is a scene at the end of the first week's show where Mancuso attends the unveiling of the memorial to his dead partner David.
41 <TAB> 42 <TAB> Asked to say a few words, he pulls out his crumpled piece of paper and tries to talk, but he's too choked up to get the words out.
42 <TAB> 43 <TAB> He bangs on the piece of paper in frustration, then turns and walks away.
43 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It was a profoundly moving moment for series television, and Robert Loggia's acting resonated in the silence.
44 <TAB> -1 <TAB> There's a pretty good program inside all the noise of "Mancuso FBI." If the show's creators could just let themselves be quiet for a little, they might just hear it.

9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> And although Mr. Roman and WPP's chief executive, Martin Sorrell, have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other, people close to Mr. Roman say he was unhappy giving up control of the company.
10 <TAB> 19 <TAB> Some executives also cite tension because of efforts by Mr. Sorrell, a financial man, to cut costs at the agency.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Mr. Roman will be succeeded as the head of Ogilvy's flagship ad agency, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, by Graham Phillips, 50, who had been president of North American operations and who, like Mr. Sorrell, is British.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Alexander Brody, 56, will take on the newly created position of president of the world-wide agency and chief executive of its international operations.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He had been president of the international operations.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Roman also had overseen Ogilvy Group's two other units, the Scali McCabe Sloves advertising agency and its research division, but those units will now report directly to WPP.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Mr. Roman appears custom-made for the American Express job.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Known as a traditional executive, he is very much in the conservative American Express mold.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Moreover, after 26 years at Ogilvy he had honed a reputation for being squeaky-clean and a straight arrow -- which can only help American Express in the wake of the Safra incident.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He also is close to American Express's chairman and chief executive officer, James D. Robinson III. Aside from working with Mr. Robinson on the American Express advertising account for about 11 years, Mr. Roman serves on several of the same charities and boards as Mr. Robinson.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> The abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation that Mr. Roman had been pushed out of Ogilvy's top spot by Mr. Sorrell.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> But Mr. Roman flatly denied the speculation, saying Mr. Sorrell had tried several times to persuade him to stay, offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine (The wine, naturally, was Seagram's brand, an Ogilvy client). "He asked me not to resign.
21 <TAB> 28 <TAB> The implication that I was pushed aside wouldn't be accurate," Mr. Roman said.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Sorrell, traveling in the Far East, couldn't be reached.
23 <TAB> 26 <TAB> Mr. Roman said American Express's Mr. Robinson first approached him about the job in late September.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> According to industry executives, Peter Sutherland, a former European Community commissioner from Ireland, was also a serious contender for the American Express job.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Although it ultimately wasn't offered to him, he will be on retainer to American Express as an adviser on international matters.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> After talking on and off for the past four weeks, Mr. Roman said, he agreed to take the job because "it's the right time, it's a terrific opportunity, and I think I leave the company in very strong hands.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It was my decision, not anyone else's."
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> Mr. Roman also brushed aside reports about infighting between him and Mr. Phillips, his successor at Ogilvy.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> The two executives could hardly be more different.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> Mr. Roman comes across as a low-key executive; Mr. Phillips has a flashier personality.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> During time off, Mr. Roman tends to his garden; Mr. Phillips confesses to a fondness for, among other things, fast cars and planes.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Industry executives say that although the two executives used to clash more frequently, the WPP takeover brought them closer together.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> "I'm the guy who made him head of New York, head of the U.S., president of North America, and recommended him {to Mr. Sorrell} as my successor.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Would I have done all those things successively if I didn't think he was the right guy?" Mr. Roman asked.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He labeled reports of friction "ridiculous," and said that he spent part of the weekend on Mr. Phillips's boat in Connecticut.
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> Mr. Roman will oversee American Express's public relations and government affairs, among other things, but he won't be involved in its advertising, which is handled by the operating units. "I consider this a second career," he said.
37 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He also will sit on the company's corporate planning and policy committee, made up of the top corporate and operating executives.
38 <TAB> 39 <TAB> Mr. Roman's departure isn't expected to have any enormous repercussions at Ogilvy.
39 <TAB> -1 <TAB> American Express, Kraft General Foods, and Mattel executives said the move won't affect their relationships with the ad agency. "General Foods's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies' work, and will continue to be," said David Hurwitt, a vice president of Kraft General Foods.
40 <TAB> 41 <TAB> But some clients and analysts expressed concern that Mr. Phillips isn't as well-known to many clients. "Ken was my key contact," said J. Nicholas Hahn, president and chief executive officer of Cotton Inc., which represents cotton producers. "I don't know {Mr.
41 <TAB> 42 <TAB> Phillips} all that well.
42 <TAB> 43 <TAB> I haven't seen or talked to him in several years."
43 <TAB> 48 <TAB> And some analysts questioned whether Mr. Phillips would have the skills Ogilvy needs to turn the agency around.
44 <TAB> 45 <TAB> While the agency has done well in many parts of the world, its flagship New York office has had a dismal track record recently; it has won few new accounts while losing big ones, including Maxwell House. "I think {Mr.
45 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Phillips} is going to need some help.
46 <TAB> -1 <TAB> I think they need creative leadership, and I don't think they have it," said Emma Hill, an analyst with Wertheim & Co.
47 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Ogilvy & Mather's top creative executive, Norman Berry, left the agency earlier this year. "Norm Berry was a creative inspiration at the company, and nobody has filled that void," said Ms. Hill.
48 <TAB> 49 <TAB> But other analysts said that having Mr. Phillips succeed Mr. Roman would make for a smooth transition. "Graham Phillips has been there a long time, knows the culture well, is aggressive, and apparently gets along well with" Mr. Sorrell, said Andrew Wallach, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert. "It's probably a reasonable transition.
49 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Hopefully, he'll be the answer to the problems they've had in New York."

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It's a California crime saga worthy of an Erle Stanley Gardner title: The Case of the Purloined Palm Trees.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Edward Carlson awoke one morning last month to find eight holes in his front yard where his prized miniature palms, called cycads, once stood.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Days later, the thieves returned and dug out more, this time adding insult to injury. "The second time," he says, "they left the shovel."
3 <TAB> 8 <TAB> No garden-variety crime, palm-tree rustling is sprouting up all over Southern California, bringing big bucks to crooks who know their botany.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Cycads, the most popular of which is the Sago Palm, are doll-sized versions of California's famous long-necked palms, with stubby trunks and fern-like fronds.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Because the Sago is relatively rare and grows only a couple of inches a year, it's a pricey lawn decoration: A two-foot tall Sago can retail for $1,000, and taller ones often fetch $3,000 or more.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "Evidently, somebody has realized it's easy money to steal these things," says Loran Whitelock, a research associate specializing in cycads at the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Just last week, would-be thieves damaged three Sagos at Mr. Whitelock's home in the Eagle Rock section before something frightened them off, foiled. "It's hard to think someone is raping your garden," he says.
8 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Police suspect that the criminals, who dig up the plants in the dead of night, are selling them to nurseries or landscapers.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Sago has become a popular accent in tony new housing tracts, apparently giving the rustlers a ready market for their filched fronds.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Thieves are going to find "anybody who has enough bucks to plant these things in their front yard," says William Morrissey, an investigator with the police department in Garden Grove, Calif., where five such thefts have been reported in the past several weeks.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The department is advising residents to plant Sagos, if they must, in the back yard and telling nurseries to be on the lookout for anyone trying to palm one off.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But for those Californians who want exotic gardens out front where neighbors can appreciate them, there's always Harold Smith's approach.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> After three Sagos were stolen from his home in Garden Grove, "I put a big iron stake in the ground and tied the tree to the stake with a chain," he says proudly. "And you can't cut this chain with bolt cutters."

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Earnings for most of the nation's major pharmaceutical makers are believed to have moved ahead briskly in the third quarter, as companies with newer, big-selling prescription drugs fared especially well.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For the third consecutive quarter, however, most of the companies' revenues were battered by adverse foreign-currency translations as a result of the strong dollar abroad.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Analysts said that Merck & Co., Eli Lilly & Co., Warner-Lambert Co. and the Squibb Corp. unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. all benefited from strong sales of relatively new, higher-priced medicines that provide wide profit margins.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Less robust earnings at Pfizer Inc. and Upjohn Co. were attributed to those companies' older products, many of which face stiffening competition from generic drugs and other medicines.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Joseph Riccardo, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co., said that over the past few years most drug makers have shed their slow-growing businesses and instituted other cost savings, such as consolidating manufacturing plants and administrative staffs.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> As a result, "major new products are having significant impact, even on a company with very large revenues," Mr. Riccardo said.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Analysts said profit for the dozen or so big drug makers, as a group, is estimated to have climbed between 11% and 14%.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> While that's not spectacular, Neil Sweig, an analyst with Prudential Bache, said that the rate of growth will "look especially good as compared to other companies if the economy turns downward."
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Mr. Sweig estimated that Merck's profit for the quarter rose by about 22%, propelled by sales of its line-up of fast-growing prescription drugs, including its anti-cholesterol drug, Mevacor; a high blood pressure medicine, Vasotec; Primaxin, an antibiotic, and Pepcid, an anti-ulcer medication.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Profit climbed even though Merck's sales were reduced by "one to three percentage points" as a result of the strong dollar, Mr. Sweig said.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> In the third quarter of 1988, Merck earned $311.8 million, or 79 cents a share.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In Rahway, N.J., a Merck spokesman said the company doesn't make earnings projections.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Mr. Sweig said he estimated that Lilly's earnings for the quarter jumped about 20%, largely because of the performance of its new anti-depressant Prozac.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> The drug, introduced last year, is expected to generate sales of about $300 million this year. "It's turning out to be a real blockbuster," Mr. Sweig said.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> In last year's third quarter, Lilly earned $171.4 million, or $1.20 a share.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In Indianapolis, Lilly declined comment.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Several analysts said they expected Warner-Lambert's profit also to increase by more than 20% from $87.7 million, or $1.25 a share, it reported in the like period last year.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> The company is praised by analysts for sharply lowering its costs in recent years and shedding numerous companies with low profit margins.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> The company's lean operation, analysts said, allowed sharp-rising sales from its cholesterol drug, Lopid, to power earnings growth.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Lopid sales are expected to be about $300 million this year, up from $190 million in 1988.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In Morris Plains, N.J., a spokesman for the company said the analysts' projections are "in the ballpark."
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Squibb's profit, estimated by analysts to be about 18% above the $123 million, or $1.25 a share, it earned in the third quarter of 1988, was the result of especially strong sales of its Capoten drug for treating high blood pressure and other heart disease.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> The company was officially merged with Bristol-Myers Co. earlier this month.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Bristol-Myers declined to comment.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> Mr. Riccardo of Bear Stearns said that Schering-Plough Corp. 's expected profit rise of about 18% to 20%, and Bristol-Meyers's expected profit increase of about 13% are largely because "those companies are really managed well." ScheringPlough earned $94.4 million, or 84 cents a share, while Bristol-Myers earned $232.3 million, or 81 cents a share, in the like period a year earlier.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> In Madison, N.J., a spokesman for Schering-Plough said the company has "no problems" with the average estimate by a analysts that third-quarter earnings per share rose by about 19%, to $1.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The company expects to achieve the 20% increase in full-year earnings per share, as it projected in the spring, the spokesman said.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> Meanwhile, analysts said Pfizer's recent string of lackluster quarterly performances continued, as earnings in the quarter were expected to decline by about 5%.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> Sales of Pfizer's important drugs, Feldene for treating arthritis, and Procardia, a heart medicine, have shrunk because of increased competition. "The (strong) dollar hurt Pfizer a lot, too," Mr. Sweig said.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In the third quarter last year, Pfizer earned $216.8 million, or $1.29 a share.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In New York, the company declined comment.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> Analysts said they expected Upjohn's profit to be flat or rise by only about 2% to 4% as compared with $89.6 million, or 49 cents a share, it earned a year ago.
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> Upjohn's biggest-selling drugs are Xanax, a tranquilizer, and Halcion, a sedative.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> Sales of both drugs have been hurt by new state laws restricting the prescriptions of certain tranquilizing medicines and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Also, the company's hair-growing drug, Rogaine, is selling well -- at about $125 million for the year, but the company's profit from the drug has been reduced by Upjohn's expensive print and television campaigns for advertising, analysts said.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Inco Ltd. posted a 35% decline in third-quarter net income, a performance that was in line with analysts' expectations.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> The nickel producer also raised its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share from 20 cents and said it may buy back as much as 4.8% of its common outstanding.
2 <TAB> 4 <TAB> Inco shares fell after the announcements.
3 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Analysts said some investors were disappointed that the cash-rich company had failed to announce a special dividend.
4 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Inco closed at $31.125 a share, down 62.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Some analysts said Inco, which had cash reserves of $272 million as of Sept. 30, could still announce a special dividend in the next few months, though it would be smaller than the $10-a-share special dividend it paid last year.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The quarterly dividend is payable Dec. 1 to shares of record Nov. 3.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Inco's net fell to $129.3 million, or $1.23 a share, in the third quarter from $200.3 million, or $1.88 a share, a year earlier.

10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Inco said the drop in earnings resulted mainly from lower nickel prices for the period and a temporary cut in nickel output at the company's Manitoba operations due to high levels of arsenic in the ore.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Inco said it plans to buy back as many as five million common shares over the next 12 months if nickel market conditions are favorable.

0 <TAB> 4 <TAB> Investors dumped stocks of big companies whose earnings fluctuate with the economy.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Many of those "cyclical" issues are in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell 26.23 to 2662.91.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outpaced advancers, 1,012 to 501.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Recession fears are springing up again among investors.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Analysts say that the selling of cyclical stocks yesterday will be followed by a sell-off in shares of companies with big debt loads on their balance sheets.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> In an economic slowdown, heavy debt loads reduce the flexibility of companies because cash that would normally be used to keep the company buoyant must be diverted to interest payments.
6 <TAB> 10 <TAB> On the other hand, investors beat a clear path yesterday to blue-chip issues with proven earnings growth records.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Among the 30 Dow industrials, they bought McDonald's, Coca-Cola Co. and Procter & Gamble and sold Aluminum Co. of America.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In another sign of slowdown fears, investors dumped technology shares.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Many money managers are bracing for a decline in stocks of companies with big debt loads on their balance sheets. "The junk bond market is being taken apart" because of recession fears, said J. David Mills, senior vice president at Boston Company Advisers. "Under this scrutiny, the first thing you do is sell your cyclical stocks and the second thing you do is sell your over-leveraged companies."
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In fact, much of the buying in blue chips yesterday was a pursuit of companies with lower debt levels.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> In a recent investment letter entitled "Winners of the `Leverage Wars, ' " Edward Kerschner, chairman of PaineWebber's investment policy committee, suggested that investors buy stocks of companies that have avoided loading up on debt.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> "We're saying companies have to pay increasing attention to balance sheets," said Mr. Kerschner.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> He suggested that investors buy the shares of Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea, J. Baker, McDonald's, Philip Morris and Sara Lee.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> He said that all of these companies will be able to compete fiercely in an economic downturn.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> McDonald's has long-term debt equaling 91% of shareholder equity currently, but Mr. Kerschner said the company is carrying real estate assets at about $2.6 billion below their real value.

19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> According to Salomon Brothers' "stub" stock index of 20 companies whose debt is giant compared with shareholder equity, investors are already beginning to retreat from shares of debt-laden companies.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> From January to early September, the index of stub stocks -- the tiny portion of equity that's publicly traded following a recapitalization -- outperformed Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by about 20%.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But starting in early September, the index started to slide and now stands about even with the S&P 500.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "Stocks that have a high default risk have started to underperform those stocks that have a lower default risk," said Eric Sorenson, director of quantitative analysis at Salomon Brothers. "Companies that have the most exposure to the business cycle have underperformed since late last summer."

28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Pinnacle West Capital, whose earnings have been hurt by continued problems at its MeraBank unit, fell 1 5/8 to 9 1/8 on 2.1 million shares to lead the Big Board's list of most active issues.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Growing pressures on the Arizona real-estate market are affecting the thrift; Pinnacle West told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report it may consider filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection if it can't reach an agreement with federal regulators to provide additional capital to MeraBank.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Hercules dropped 2 5/8 to 41 3/4 on one million shares -- about six times its average daily trading volume -- after a disappointing third-quarter earnings report.

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This is in response to George Melloan's Business World column "The Housing Market Is a Bigger Mess Than You Think" (op-ed page, Sept. 26).
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> In Houston, we have seen how bad the housing problem can become.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Unused houses deteriorate rapidly, affecting the value of nearby homes; in a domino effect, the entire neighborhood can fall victim.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> At this stage some people just "walk away" from homes where the mortgage exceeds current market value.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But most of them could have afforded to keep up their payments -- they chose not to do so.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> The problem is so vast that we need to try innovative solutions -- in small-scale experiments.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Here are some ideas:
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> 1) Foreclosed homes could be sold by the FHA for no down payment (the biggest obstacle to young buyers), but with personal liability for the mortgage (no walking away by choice).
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> 2) Encourage long-term occupancy by forgiving one month's payment (off the tail end of the mortgage) for every six months paid; or perhaps have the down payment deferred to the end of the mortgage (balloon), but "forgiven" on a monthly pro-rata basis as long as the owner remains the occupant.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> 3) Develop rental agreements with exclusive purchase options for the renter.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> An occupant will, in most every case, be better for the home and neighborhood than a vacant house.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In this way, the house is not dumped on to a glutted market.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> John F. Merrill
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Houston
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> The Federal Housing Administration, Veterans Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development further aggravate the problem of affordable housing stock by "buying in" to their foreclosed properties (of which there are, alas, many) at an inflated "balance due" -- say $80,000 on a house worth $55,000 -- instead of allowing a free market to price the house for what it's really worth.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Worse, the properties then sit around deteriorating for maybe a year or so, but are resold eventually (because of the attractiveness of the low down payment, etc.) to a marginal buyer who can't afford both the mortgage and needed repairs; and having little vested interest that buyer will walk away and the vicious cycle repeats itself all over again.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Norfolk Southern Corp. directors authorized the railroad company to buy back as many as 45 million of its shares, which would have a current value of more than $1.7 billion.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> The buy-back, coupled with a nearly completed earlier purchase of 20 million shares, would reduce shares outstanding by more than 26%.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> The Norfolk, Va., company has 172.2 million shares outstanding.
3 <TAB> 12 <TAB> In a statement, Arnold B. McKinnon, chairman and chief executive officer, noted that the new repurchase program "should serve to enhance shareholder value." A spokeswoman said the company will finance the buy-back with cash on hand, borrowing and "cash Norfolk expects to generate."
4 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Analysts said they expected the action, and investors applauded the move.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Norfolk Southern shares closed at $37.875, up $1.125.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Still, analysts don't expect the buy-back to significantly affect per-share earnings in the short term. "The impact won't be that great," said Graeme Lidgerwood of First Boston Corp.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That is in part because of the effect of having to average the number of shares outstanding, she said.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> In addition, Mrs. Lidgerwood said, Norfolk is likely to draw down its cash initially to finance the purchases and thus forfeit some interest income.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Longer term, however, the buy-back is expected to increase earnings, especially after 1990, Mrs. Lidgerwood said.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Moreover, the extensive program in effect establishes a floor for the stock price, said Joel Price, analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The buy-back "is really a comfort to those who want to buy the stock that there is a {price} floor," he said. "At a certain price, if the management thinks {the stock} is cheap, they can go in and buy it."
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Under the program, Norfolk plans to acquire shares in the open market.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Boston Co., the upper-crust financial services concern that was rocked by a management scandal late last year, has had a sharp drop in profitability -- mainly because a high-risk bet on interest rates backfired.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Boston Co. 's fall from grace is bad news for its parent, Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc., which has relied heavily on the banking and money management unit's contributions in recent years.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> In 1988, for example, Boston Co. had an estimated pretax profit of at least $110 million, while Shearson managed net income of just $96 million.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Shearson doesn't break out the earnings of its subsidiaries.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But people familiar with Boston Co. 's performance say the unit had profit of around $17 million for the third quarter, after barely breaking even for the first six months.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Shearson, meanwhile, posted net income of $106 million for the first nine months of the year, down slightly from $110 million for the year-ago period.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Moody's Investors Service Inc. last week downgraded the long-term deposit rating of Boston Co. 's Boston Safe Deposit & Trust Co. subsidiary, to single-A-1 from double-A-3, citing problems in the company's "aggressively managed securities portfolio."
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> John Kriz, a Moody's vice president, said Boston Safe Deposit's performance has been hurt this year by a mismatch in the maturities of its assets and liabilities.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> The mismatch exposed the company to a high degree of interest-rate risk, and when rates moved unfavorably -- beginning late last year and continuing into this year -- "it cost them," Mr. Kriz said.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Mr. Kriz noted that Boston Safe Deposit "has taken some actions to better control asset-liability management and improve controls in general, and we think these will serve to improve credit quality." As some securities mature and the proceeds are reinvested, the problems ought to ease, he said.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But he also cited concerns over the company's mortgage exposure in the troubled New England real estate market.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Boston Co. officials declined to comment on Moody's action or on the unit's financial performance this year -- except to deny a published report that outside accountants had discovered evidence of significant accounting errors in the first three quarters' results.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> An accounting controversy at the end of last year forced Boston Co. to admit it had overstated pretax profits by some $44 million.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> The resulting scandal led to the firing of James N. von Germeten as Boston Co. 's president and to the resignations of the company's chief financial officer and treasurer.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> The executives were accused of improperly deferring expenses and booking revenue early, in an effort to dress up results -- and perhaps bolster performance-related bonuses.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. von Germeten, in turn, attributed the controversy to judgmental errors by accountants and accused Shearson of conducting a "witch hunt."
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Mr. Kriz of Moody's said the problems in the securities portfolio stem largely from positions taken last year.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The company's current management found itself "locked into this," he said.

2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> A sudden, forced cutback by consumers, who normally account for about two-thirds of economic activity, would damp the economy at a time when plant-and-equipment spending is slowing and deficit-racked governments can't readily take up the slack.

He adds: "We are now witnessing a slowdown which, if history is a guide, could persist for a while."
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> But what about the debt burden?
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Mr. Durkin doubts that "there is some magic level" at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income "indicates economic problems." And, "more importantly," he says, "the debt burden measured other ways is not really in uncharted waters."
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> The chart below shows why (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 23, 1989).
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> The ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income, though up a bit, hasn't climbed steeply, and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Moreover, the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be "lower in this cycle than earlier," Mr. Durkin says.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> He notes that some "revolving credit-card credit is actually convenience credit" being used simply as a handy way of paying bills rather than a handy way of borrowing.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> In addition, he says, "longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of repayments and the accompanying payment burden."
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> And if you "consider the changing distribution of credit," Mr. Durkin says, "much of the increase in debt in recent years is due to increasing credit use by higher-income families," that is, "those probably best able to handle it."
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Citing figures on home-equity loans, he notes that "11% of homeowners had home-equity credit accounts, but the proportion rises to 16% of homeowners in the $45,000-$60,000 income range and 23% of homeowners with income above $60,000." And much home-equity credit is used conservatively. "The most frequent use is home improvement, which presumably improves the value of the property," Mr. Durkin says.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> So, it isn't surprising that consumer-credit delinquencies at banks remain, as the chart shows, reassuringly below some earlier highs (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 23, 1989).
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> A severe recession could, of course, raise delinquency rates, but so far the current levels of consumer debt don't seem to loom as a major threat.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> In fact, the current weakness in auto buying and department-store sales and the gradual upturn in the household saving rate suggest that consumers, conservative as ever, are already clutching their purses a bit more tightly.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> In July, consumer installment credit outstanding fell for the first time since January 1987.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> "Consumers appear unwilling to add to their leverage to support their spending," Bruce Steinberg, a Merrill Lynch economist, says. "As a result, household debt appears to be stabilizing at around 63% of GNP."
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Consumers, credit cards in hand, aren't running amok through the shopping malls -- or putting the economy at any great risk.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> RJR Nabisco Inc. is disbanding its division responsible for buying network advertising time, just a month after moving 11 of the group's 14 employees to New York from Atlanta.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A spokesman for the New York-based food and tobacco giant, taken private earlier this year in a $25 billion leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., confirmed that it is shutting down the RJR Nabisco Broadcast unit, and dismissing its 14 employees, in a move to save money.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> The spokesman said RJR is discussing its network-buying plans with its two main advertising firms, FCB/Leber Katz and McCann Erickson.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> "We found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost," said the spokesman, who declined to specify how much RJR spends on network television time.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> An executive close to the company said RJR is spending about $140 million on network television time this year, down from roughly $200 million last year.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> The spokesman said the broadcast unit will be disbanded Dec. 1, and the move won't affect RJR's print, radio and spot-television buying practices.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> The broadcast group had been based in New York until a year ago, when RJR's previous management moved it to Atlanta, the company's headquarters before this summer.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> One employee with the group said RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September because "there was supposed to be a future." He said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks, wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The RJR spokesman said the company moved the 11 employees to New York last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks' upcoming season. "The studies {on closing the unit} couldn't be completed until now," he said.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> In Bombay stock market circles, the buzzword is "mega." At least 40 companies are coming to the capital market to raise $6 billion, an amount never thought possible in India.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "When they talk mega-issues, they're truly talking mega," says S.A. Dave, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India. "The capital market is booming."
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> But the mega-issues are raising megaquestions about the rapidly evolving Indian capital market.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> One is whether there is enough money to fund the new issues without depressing stock trading.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Moreover, in the relatively unregulated Indian stock markets, investors frequently don't know what they are getting when they subscribe to an issue.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> A prospectus in India doesn't always tell a potential investor much.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Some of the large amounts are being raised by small firms.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> In addition, once money is raised, investors usually have no way of knowing how it is spent.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Some analysts are concerned that the mega-issues, in such an unregulated environment, could lead to a mega-crash. "The rate of failures will be much more than the rate of successes in the mega-projects," says G.S. Patel, a former chairman of the giant, government-run mutual fund, the Unit Trust of India. "They're going to have mega-problems."
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> The Indian stock markets have been on a five-year high, with dips and corrections, since Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi started liberalizing industry.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> But the last stock market boom, in 1986, seems small compared with the current rush to market.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> The $6 billion that some 40 companies are looking to raise in the year ending March 31 compares with only $2.7 billion raised on the capital market in the previous fiscal year.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In fiscal 1984, before Mr. Gandhi came to power, only $810 million was raised.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> This year's biggest issue, $570 million of convertible debentures by engineering company Larsen & Toubro Ltd., is the largest in Indian history.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And it isn't the only giant issue: together, the top four issues will raise $1.3 billion.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Convertible debentures -- bonds that can later be converted into equity shares -- are the most popular instrument this year, though many companies are also selling nonconvertible bonds or equity shares.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> These mega-issues are being propelled by two factors, economic and political.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> In the past, the socialist policies of the government strictly limited the size of new steel mills, petrochemical plants, car factories and other industrial concerns to conserve resources and restrict the profits businessmen could make.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> As a result, industry operated out of small, expensive, highly inefficient industrial units.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> When Mr. Gandhi came to power, he ushered in new rules for business.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> He said industry should build plants on the same scale as those outside India and benefit from economies of scale.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If the output was too great for the domestic market, he said, companies should export.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> India's overregulated businessmen had to be persuaded, but they have started to think big.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Some of the projects being funded by the new issues are the first fruits of Mr. Gandhi's policy, and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units built in the past.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The industrial revolution has produced an explosion in the capital market, which is a far cheaper source of funds than government-controlled banks, where interest rates for prime borrowers are around 16%.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The second factor spurring mega-issues is political.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> Mr. Gandhi has called general elections for November, and many businessmen fear that he and his Congress (I) Party will lose.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> Some companies are raising money in anticipation of a government less predictable than Mr. Gandhi's, and possibly more restrictive.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> The buoyant Bombay rumor mill also says that some of the money raised in the current spate of issues will be used as campaign donations before the elections.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> No one admits to anything, but India's industrialists have a history of making under-the-table campaign donations.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> So far, the mega-issues are a hit with investors.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Earlier this year, Tata Iron & Steel Co. 's offer of $355 million of convertible debentures was oversubscribed.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Essar Gujarat Ltd., a marine construction company, had similar success with a slightly smaller issue.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Larsen & Toubro started accepting applications for its giant issue earlier this month; bankers and analysts expect it to be oversubscribed.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Still to come are big issues by Bindal Agro Chem Ltd., a petrochemical and agrochemical company, and Usha Rectifier Corp. (India), a semiconductor maker.
35 <TAB> 36 <TAB> While many investors are selling parts of their portfolios to buy the new issues, prices on India's 16 stock exchanges are holding up so far.
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> "I don't think it will lead to any chaos in the secondary market," says Mr. Patel, "only a sagging tendency." Says M.J. Pherwani, chairman of the Unit Trust of India: The "markets are headed for growth unheard of and unseen before."
37 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But with growth come growing pains, and never has this been clearer on the Indian capital market than now.
38 <TAB> 39 <TAB> In the past, the government controlled the markets indirectly, through its tight grip on industry itself.
39 <TAB> 40 <TAB> Various ministries decided the products businessmen could produce and how much; and government-owned banks controlled the financing of projects and monitored whether companies came through on promised plans.
40 <TAB> 41 <TAB> The government has been content with this far-reaching, subtle form of control, exercised on a case-by-case basis with no clear rules or guidelines.
41 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But now, with large amounts being raised from investors, the government's dawdling on regulation and disclosure requirements has a more dangerous aspect.
42 <TAB> 43 <TAB> The Securities and Exchange Board of India was set up earlier this year, along the lines of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but New Delhi hasn't pushed the legislation to make it operational.
43 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Dave, its head, acts cheery and patient, but he makes no bones about the need to get to work.
44 <TAB> 45 <TAB> "Mega or non-mega, we feel the prospectus standards need to be considerably improved," he says. "Disclosures are very poor in India." He says the big questions -- "Do you really need this much money to put up these investments?
45 <TAB> 46 <TAB> Have you told investors what is happening in your sector?
46 <TAB> 47 <TAB> What about your track record? -- "aren't asked of companies coming to market.
47 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Instead, he says, most investors have to rely on the rumor-happy Indian press.
48 <TAB> 49 <TAB> An example is the biggest offering of them all, Larsen & Toubro's $570 million bond issue.
49 <TAB> 50 <TAB> The engineering company was acquired in a takeover earlier this year by the giant Reliance textile group.
50 <TAB> 53 <TAB> Although Larsen & Toubro hadn't raised money from the public in 38 years, its new owners frequently raise funds on the local market. (Reliance floated a $357 million petrochemical company in 1988 that was, at the time, the largest public issue in Indian history.) The media has raised questions about Larsen & Toubro's issue, pointing out that it exceeds the company's annual sales and its market capitalization.
51 <TAB> 52 <TAB> Even stranger is the case of Usha Rectifier, a semiconductor company with 1988 sales of $28 million that's raising $270 million to build an iron plant.
52 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Once the money is raised, it isn't always certain how it is used.
53 <TAB> 54 <TAB> Larsen & Toubro, for example, says it's raising $570 million to use as supplier credit on large engineering jobs.
54 <TAB> 55 <TAB> Unlike other companies, it hasn't pin-pointed specific projects for the funds.
55 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And even when specific projects are described in prospectuses, the money often is used elsewhere, according to analysts.
56 <TAB> 57 <TAB> "Someone must monitor where the funds are deployed," says Mr. Dave.
57 <TAB> 58 <TAB> Mr. Patel agrees: "There is no proper monitoring and screening of the use of these funds.
58 <TAB> 59 <TAB> They're trying to plug the various loopholes, but they're totally unprepared for this."
59 <TAB> 60 <TAB> Because of the large amounts of money being raised, the loose disclosure requirements and the casual monitoring of how the money is used, some analysts fear that there could be a few mega-crashes, which could hurt market confidence far more than the small bankruptcies that followed the boom of 1986.
60 <TAB> 61 <TAB> The government insists that such a possibility is low.
61 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It says that despite loose regulation of the market itself, its longstanding regulation of industry will prevent such crashes.

0 <TAB> 2 <TAB> These are the last words Abbie Hoffman ever uttered, more or less, before he killed himself.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And You Are There, sort of:
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> ABBIE: "I'm OK, Jack.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> I'm OK." (listening) "Yeah.

10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> ABBIE (cont'd.): "I'll always be with you, Jack.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Don't worry."
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Abbie lies back and leaves the frame empty.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Of course that wasn't the actual conversation the late anti-war activist, protest leader and founder of the Yippies ever had with his brother.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> It's a script pieced together from interviews by CBS News for a re-enactment, a dramatic rendering by an actor of Mr. Hoffman's ultimately unsuccessful struggle with depression.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The segment is soon to be broadcast on the CBS News series "Saturday Night With Connie Chung," thus further blurring the distinction between fiction and reality in TV news.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It is the New Journalism come to television.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Ms. Chung's program is just one of several network shows (and many more in syndication) that rely on the controversial technique of reconstructing events, using actors who are supposed to resemble real people, living and dead.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Ms. Chung's, however, is said to be the only network news program in history to employ casting directors.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Abbie Hoffman in this case is to be played by Hollywood actor Paul Lieber, who isn't new to the character.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He was Mr. Hoffman in a 1979 Los Angeles production of a play called "The Chicago Conspiracy Trial."
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Television news, of course, has always been part show-biz.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> Broadcasters have a healthy appreciation of the role entertainment values play in captivating an audience.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But, as CBS Broadcast Group president Howard Stringer puts it, the network now needs to "broaden the horizons of nonfiction television, and that includes some experimentation."
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Since its premiere Sept. 16, the show on which Ms. Chung appears has used an actor to portray the Rev. Vernon Johns, a civil-rights leader, and one to play a teenage drug dealer.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It has depicted the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> On Oct. 21, it did a rendition of the kidnapping and imprisonment of Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson, who was abducted in March 1985 and is believed to be held in Lebanon.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The production had actors playing Mr. Anderson and former hostages David Jacobsen, the Rev. Benjamin Weir and Father Lawrence Jenco.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> ABC News has similarly branched out into entertainment gimmickry. "Prime Time Live," a new show this season featuring Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer, has a studio audience that applauds and that one night (to the embarrassment of the network) waved at the camera like the crowd on "Let's Make a Deal." (ABC stops short of using an "applause" sign and a comic to warm up the audience.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> The stars do that themselves.) NBC News has produced three episodes of an occasional series produced by Sid Feders called "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow," starring Maria Shriver, Chuck Scarborough and Mary Alice Williams, that also gives work to actors.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> Call it a fad.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Or call it the wave of the future.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> NBC's re-creations are produced by Cosgrove-Meurer Productions, which also makes the successful prime-time NBC Entertainment series "Unsolved Mysteries."
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The marriage of news and theater, if not exactly inevitable, has been consummated nonetheless.
34 <TAB> 35 <TAB> News programs, particularly if they score well in the ratings, appeal to the networks' cost-conscious corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to produce than an entertainment show is -- somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 for a one-hour program.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Entertainment shows tend to cost twice that.
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> Re-enactments have been used successfully for several seasons on such syndicated "tabloid TV" shows as "A Current Affair," which is produced by the Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
37 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That show, whose host is Ms. Chung's husband, Maury Povich, has a particular penchant for grisly murders and stories having to do with sex -- the Robert Chambers murder case, the Rob Lowe tapes, what have you.
38 <TAB> 39 <TAB> Gerald Stone, the executive producer of "A Current Affair," says, "We have opened eyes to being a little less conservative and more imaginative in how to present the news."
39 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Nowhere have eyes been opened wider than at CBS News.
40 <TAB> -1 <TAB> At 555 W. 57th St. in Manhattan, one floor below the offices of "60 Minutes," the most successful prime-time news program ever, actors wait in the reception area to audition for "Saturday Night With Connie Chung."
41 <TAB> -1 <TAB> CBS News sends scripts to agents, who pass them along to clients.
42 <TAB> 43 <TAB> The network deals a lot with unknowns, including Scott Wentworth, who portrayed Mr. Anderson, and Bill Alton as Father Jenco, but the network has some big names to contend with, too.
43 <TAB> 44 <TAB> James Earl Jones is cast to play the Rev. Mr. Johns.
44 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Ned Beatty may portray former California Gov. Pat Brown in a forthcoming epsiode on Caryl Chessman, the last man to be executed in California, in 1960.
45 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "Saturday Night" has cast actors to appear in future stories ranging from the abortion rights of teen-agers to a Nov. 4 segment on a man named Willie Bosket, who calls himself a "monster" and is reputed to be the toughest prisoner in New York.
46 <TAB> 47 <TAB> CBS News, which as recently as two years ago fired hundreds of its employees in budget cutbacks, now hires featured actors beginning at $2,700 a week.
47 <TAB> 48 <TAB> That isn't much compared with what Bill Cosby makes, or even Connie Chung for that matter (who is paid $1.6 million a year and who recently did a guest shot of her own on the sitcom "Murphy Brown").
48 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But the money isn't peanuts either, particularly for a news program.
49 <TAB> 50 <TAB> CBS News is also re-enacting the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Middletown, Pa., with something less than a cast of thousands.
50 <TAB> 51 <TAB> It is combing the town of 10,000 for about 200 extras.
51 <TAB> -1 <TAB> On Oct. 20, the town's mayor, Robert Reid, made an announcement on behalf of CBS during half-time at the Middletown High School football game asking for volunteers.
52 <TAB> 53 <TAB> "There was a roll of laughter through the stands," says Joe Sukle, the editor of the weekly Press and Journal in Middletown. "They're filming right now at the bank down the street, and they want shots of people getting out of cars and kids on skateboards.
53 <TAB> 54 <TAB> They are approaching everyone on the street and asking if they want to be in a docudrama."
54 <TAB> 55 <TAB> Mr. Sukle says he wouldn't dream of participating himself: "No way.
55 <TAB> 56 <TAB> I think re-enactments stink."
56 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Though a re-enactment may have the flavor, Hollywood on the Hudson it isn't.
57 <TAB> 58 <TAB> Some producers seem tentative about the technique, squeamish even.
58 <TAB> 59 <TAB> So the results, while not news, aren't exactly theater either, at least not good theater.
59 <TAB> 60 <TAB> And some people do think that acting out scripts isn't worthy of CBS News, which once lent prestige to the network and set standards for the industry.
60 <TAB> 61 <TAB> In his review of "Saturday Night With Connie Chung," Tom Shales, the TV critic of the Washington Post and generally an admirer of CBS, wrote that while the show is "impressive, . . . one has to wonder if this is the proper direction for a network news division to take."
61 <TAB> 62 <TAB> Re-creating events has, in general, upset news traditionalists, including former CBS News President Richard S. Salant and former NBC News President Reuven Frank, former CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite and the new dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, Joan Konner.
62 <TAB> 63 <TAB> Says she: "Once you add dramatizations, it's no longer news, it's drama, and that has no place on a network news broadcast. . . . They should never be on.
63 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Never."
64 <TAB> 65 <TAB> Criticism of the Abbie Hoffman segment is particularly scathing among people who knew and loved the man.
65 <TAB> 66 <TAB> That includes his companion of 15 years, Johanna Lawrenson, as well as his former wife, Anita.
66 <TAB> 67 <TAB> Both women say they also find it distasteful that CBS News is apparently concentrating on Mr. Hoffman's problems as a manic-depressive.
67 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "This is dangerous and misrepresents Abbie's life," says Ms. Lawrenson, who has had an advance look at the 36-page script. "It's a sensational piece about someone who is not here to defend himself."
68 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mrs. Hoffman says that dramatization "makes the truth flexible.
69 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It takes one person's account and gives it authenticity."
70 <TAB> 71 <TAB> CBS News interviewed Jack Hoffman and his sister, Phyllis, as well as Mr. Hoffman's landlord in Solebury Township, Pa.
71 <TAB> 72 <TAB> Also Jonathan Silvers, who collaborated with Mr. Hoffman on two books.
72 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Silvers says, "I wanted to be interviewed to get Abbie's story out, and maybe talking about the illness will do some good."
73 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The executive producer of "Saturday Night With Connie Chung," Andrew Lack, declines to discuss re-creactions as a practice or his show, in particular. "I don't talk about my work," he says.
74 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The president of CBS News, David W. Burke, didn't return numerous telephone calls.
75 <TAB> -1 <TAB> One person close to the process says it would not be in the best interest of CBS News to comment on a "work in progress," such as the Hoffman re-creation, but says CBS News is "aware" of the concerns of Ms. Lawrenson and Mr. Hoffman's former wife.
76 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Neither woman was invited by CBS News to participate in a round-table discussion about Mr. Hoffman that is to follow the re-enactment.
77 <TAB> 78 <TAB> Mr. Lieber, the actor who plays Mr. Hoffman, says he was concerned at first that the script would "misrepresent an astute political mind, one that I admired," but that his concerns were allayed.
78 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The producers, he says, did a good job of depicting someone "who had done so much, but who was also a manic-depressive."

8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The metaphor of theater is not entirely coincidental.
9 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Mr. Gelbart clearly feels that all the participants in a congressional hearing -- the witnesses, the lawyers, the interrogators and the news media -- are performers.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> As the story of "Mastergate" unfolds, we learn that the Internal Revenue Service confiscated one of the properties of a foreign financier who owes the government millions in taxes.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> The man, it seems, has a Lichtenstein corporation, licensed in Libya and sheltered in the Bahamas.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> He himself lives in a "consecutive series of unnumbered houses in a town in Switzerland." The property seized by the IRS is a Hollywood film studio, Master Pictures Incorporated (MPI).
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Supposedly the IRS will sell off the assets of MPI, but before it can, a lowly IRS agent is called into the hospital room of Wylie Slaughter, the dying head of the Central Intelligence Agency.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The lowly agent, Abel Lamb, who as you might guess, is being led to the slaughter, is ordered to take over the studio.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Soon the studio is producing a $40 million picture called "Tet, the Motion Picture," to distinguish it from "Tet, the Offensive," as well as "Tet, the Book" and "Tet, the Album." The picture, to be made in the Central American country of San Elvador, is a cover for sending $800 million of arms to Los Otros, the rebel group attempting to regain neighboring Ambigua, which has been taken over by the leftist dictator Dr. Overtega, a former podiatrist, who leads a revolutionary band of foot soldiers.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The man handling all this for the now-deceased Slaughter is Major Manley Battle, Mr. Gelbart's stand in for Col. Oliver North.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Director Michael Engler has assembled a top-flight cast to carry out the impersonations of well-known political figures and to play the stock characters who invariably show up at congressional hearings.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> Daniel von Bargen is ramrod-stiff but totally assured as Major Battle, mixing just the right brand of self-righteousness and patriotism; Jeff Weiss is fire, brimstone and teary-eyed emotionalism as the far-right senator who serves as a friendly interrogator of Major Battle; Zach Grenier is maddeningly officious playing a succession of lawyers; Joseph Daly has the perfect "aw, shucks" demeanor of George Bush in his portrayal of the vice president; and Ann McDonough is first-rate as a succession of witnesses' wives.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> With one she is pregnant, with Major Battle she is knitting an American flag, and as the vice president's wife she rushes in with white hair, wearing a tailored suit and pearls, imitating Barbara Bush's gestures down to the last detail.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Though it's clear that Mr. Gelbart's sympathies do not lie with the far right, it's also true that he is evenhanded in dispensing his satirical jabs, taking sharp aim at senators and congressmen of all stripes and particularly at the media.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Mr. Gelbart also has fun with language. "Mastergate" is subtitled "a play on words," and Mr. Gelbart plays that game as well as anyone.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> He describes a Mastergate flunky as one who experienced a "meteoric disappearance" and found himself "handling blanket appeals at the Bureau of Indian Affairs."
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> This interest in words goes beyond puns and playfulness, however.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Gelbart deplores the obfuscation, the circumlocution and the debasement of language he sees on all sides.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> As the hearings begin, the self-important Sen. Bowman (Jerome Kilty) announces: "Let me emphaticize one thing at the outset: We are not looking for hides to skin nor goats to scape." Major Battle himself speaks in pure Pentagonese: "Without further monetary-stroke-military aid, scores of Ambiguan freedom lovers, who had gone way out on their life and limbs for us, were literally cut off at the knees without a paddle." At another point he intones: "Publicity is a small price to pay for secrecy."
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> The evening is short -- 95 minutes without an intermission -- but even so, as the play progresses the thrust of Mr. Gelbart's satire loses its sharpness as his targets pop up ever more predictably.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> Most of the evening, though, is filled with rare and welcome wit.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In "Mastergate," Mr. Gelbart has provided us not just one but two commodities that have all but disappeared from the Broadway theater: sharp political satire and an even sharper appreciation of the value of language.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Texaco Inc. has purchased an oil-producing company in Texas for $476.5 million, its first major acquisition since its legal brawl with Pennzoil Co. began more than four years ago.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> The White Plains, N.Y., oil company said Friday that it had acquired Tana Production Corp., a subsidiary of TRT Energy Holdings Inc., for $95.1 million in cash, with the rest to be paid in shares of a new, non-voting issue of preferred stock.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Tana, which holds properties in 17 oil and gas fields in south Texas, will provide Texaco with mostly gas reserves.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The fields contain recoverable reserves of 435 billion cubic feet of natural gas and four million barrels of oil.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "This acquisition is another indication of Texaco's commitment to increase the company's reserve base," said Chief Executive Officer James W. Kinnear.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Texaco has also been attempting to sell oil properties.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> At least two years ago, the company put 60 million barrels of oil reserves on the block.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> They were either too small or uneconomic to maintain, the company said.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Not all of those parcels have yet been sold.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Texaco acquired Tana before it completed those sales because Tana's properties are high quality and near other fields Texaco already owns, a company spokeswoman said.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Texaco, like many other oil companies, has been struggling to replace its falling oil and gas reserves.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Texaco's situation had become particularly complex because much of its effort had for years been focused on its brawl with Pennzoil and then on New York investor Carl C. Icahn's attempt to take over the company.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Pennzoil had sued Texaco for improperly interfering with its acquisition of a portion of Getty Oil Co. Eventually, Texaco, which was forced into bankruptcy proceedings by that litigation, settled its fight with Pennzoil for $3 billion in 1986.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> The airline industry's fortunes, in dazzling shape for most of the year, have taken a sudden turn for the worse in the past few weeks.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Citing rising fuel costs, promotional fare cuts and a general slowdown in travel, several major carriers have posted or are expected to post relatively poor third-quarter results.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Yesterday, USAir Group Inc., recently one of the industry's stellar performers, posted a worse-than-expected $77.7 million net loss for the period.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> So far, the industry's fourth quarter isn't looking too strong either, prompting many analysts to slash earning projections for the rest of the year by as much as one-fourth.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And they say the outlook for 1990 is nearly as bad.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Airlines in 1989 "came in like a bang and are going out like a whimper," said Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> This turn of events has put a big damper on an industry that seemed almost invincible last spring, when fares were rising at double-digit rates and many carriers seemed to be growing fat on near-monopolies in certain markets.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Now, many airline companies might become a lot less attractive as takeover targets on Wall Street.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The downturn also raises questions about the carriers' ambitious orders for new airplanes, which currently total $32.5 billion over the next three years.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> For travelers, though, the industry's problems have had some positive effects.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> In recent weeks, airlines have cut numerous fares in leisure markets to try to win back customers.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Others have tried to spruce up frequent-flier programs.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Previously, airlines were limiting the programs because they were becoming too expensive.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Just last week, for example, Trans World Airlines and Pan Am Corp. 's Pan American World Airways went so far as to offer cash rebates or gift checks of $200 to $1,000 to certain frequent-flier members making trans-Atlantic flights in business class or first class.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> The industry's slowdown became apparent this month when AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, reported an 8.8% drop in third-quarter net income and said its fourth quarter would be "disappointing." Shortly before that, USAir had said its third-quarter results would be "significantly lower" than a year earlier.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Yesterday, it provided the details: Its loss of $77.7 million, or $1.86 a share, contrasted with net of $68.5 million, or $1.58 a share, in the 1988 third quarter.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Revenue rose only 3.3% in the latest period, to $1.53 billion from $1.48 billion.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> For the nine months, the Arlington, Va., company's net plunged 73% to $38.5 million, or 76 cents a share, from $142.2 million, or $3.28 a share.
18 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Revenue rose 12% to $4.75 billion from $4.22 billion.
19 <TAB> 24 <TAB> The results surprised many analysts, because USAir has almost no competition in its Pittsburgh hub and has expanded operations by completing its acquisition of Piedmont Airlines.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Shortly after announcing its quarterly loss, USAir's stock tumbled $3 a share.
21 <TAB> 24 <TAB> It ended at $40.125, down $2.375, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> "Nobody was expecting this size of a loss," said Paul Karos, an analyst with First Boston Corp.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> One airline executive, who declined to be identified, called the loss "amazing."
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> In announcing the results, USAir cited many of the same problems that several other industry officials have named recently.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It said the industry's domestic traffic was flat in the third quarter; analysts say this was because hefty fare increases earlier in the year scared off many leisure travelers this summer.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> To try to combat the traffic slowdown, airlines started reducing fares; average fares rose only 1.7% in August, in contrast to increases of 16% each in February and March.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> But so far, the effort has failed, and traffic is still slow.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> Some other fare promotions have backfired.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This summer, the industry introduced a "kids fly free" program, in which children were allowed to fly free if they were traveling with an adult.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Airlines tried to restrict the program substantially by limiting the offer to certain days of the week, but it still was apparently used far more heavily than the airlines expected.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> Airlines also say their frequent-flier programs are squeezing profits because awards are being redeemed at a heavier-than-normal rate.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> One airline official said about three times as many free-travel coupons are being turned in as in previous years -- not surprisingly, as the airlines last year allowed many travelers to build up mileage at triple the normal rate.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> Rising operating expenses are another problem.
34 <TAB> 35 <TAB> Fuel costs were up 10% in the third quarter.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Labor costs, which leveled off in the past few years because of lower pay scales for newer employees, are on the upswing again at many carriers.
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> And some carriers are facing other unexpected headaches: USAir, for example, blamed some of its loss on merger expenses and on disruptions caused by Hurricane Hugo last month. "We cannot quantify the total adverse effects of Hugo," said Edwin Colodny, chairman and president of USAir Group.
37 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Whatever the cause for the downturn, few people are predicting any sudden improvement.
38 <TAB> 39 <TAB> Airline Economics Inc., an aviation consulting firm, is projecting an industrywide operating profit of $2.5 billion for 1989, compared with earlier forecasts of $3 billion to $3.5 billion.

21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The peril of unlimited liability looms large for a number of them now. "I have wished I could die and be out of it -- that's how bad it is," Betty Atkins, a secretary from suburban London, says.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> Ms. Atkins, whose Lloyd's membership was a bonus from a former employer in 1981, belongs to Mr. Nutting's dissident group on the Outhwaite syndicate, which has been hard hit by asbestos reinsurance claims.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Ms. Atkins, who underwrote #20,000, or about $32,000, of insurance coverage on that syndicate, now faces potential losses of roughly #70,000, or $111,000. "If Lloyd's wants #70,000 out of me they will have to take everything I've got -- and even then I don't know if it will be enough," she says.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Unease is widespread among exchange members. "I can't think of any reason to join Lloyd's now," says Keith Whitten, a British businessman and a Lloyd's member since 1979. "The downside is very considerable, and at the moment the upside is very marginal." If profits don't improve, Mr. Whitten says he may quit the exchange.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> Meanwhile, competition from rivals unencumbered by history is intensifying.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> Lloyd's is being squeezed out of low-margin but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> Over the past decade, competitors have chipped away at the exchange's share of the #2.5 billion marine market in London, where half the world's ships are insured.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Lloyd's 66% stake in that market has shrunk to 50% in that period, according to an official at the Institute of London Underwriters, a Lloyd's competitor. (The official asked not to be named.) Much of the business has gone to the institute, an association of more than 100 insurers, including Cigna Corp., Allianz Versicherungs AG of West Germany and Britain's Commercial Union Assurance PLC.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> Lloyd's has endured decades of genteel decline.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> At the peak of its power and influence a century ago, Lloyd's dominated the insurance world with a 50% stake.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> It virtually dictated how ships were to be built and it monitored commerce through a unrivaled intelligence network in ports around the globe.
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> Today, Lloyd's share of the world market, excluding life insurance, is about 2%. (Its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included.) Bigger rivals, such as Aetna and Allianz, backed by armies of statisticians using computers in hundreds of branches, operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates, brokers say.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Though Lloyd's pioneered such now-standard policies as worker's compensation insurance, burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses, and bankers' liability insurance, competitors now underwrite most of that business.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Beyond that, many big oil, chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market by insuring themselves through "captive" offshore companies for industry-specific coverage.
35 <TAB> 36 <TAB> Even Lloyd's specialty -- unusually risky ventures -- is being challenged.
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> Only 10 years ago, for instance, Lloyd's was the pre-eminent insurer of thoroughbred horses.
37 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But since 1981, Kirk Horse Insurance Inc. of Lexington, Ky. has grabbed a 20% stake of the market.
38 <TAB> 39 <TAB> Ronald Kirk, president, says Lloyd's has suffered because its structure doesn't allow underwriters to deal directly with clients; brokers are required intermediaries.
39 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Thus, he asserts, Lloyd's can't react quickly to competition. "Lloyd's has lost control of the situation," he says. "They aren't controlling their destiny like they used to."
40 <TAB> 41 <TAB> Murray Lawrence, Lloyd's chairman, agrees the exchange faces big challenges. "This is a watershed time, and we are trying to plot our way ahead," he says. "We have been a great market for inventing risks which other people then take, copy and cut rates."
41 <TAB> 42 <TAB> Lloyd's, he says, is cut off from "the vast body of premium down at the bottom end which acts as a steadying influence" against catastrophic losses.
42 <TAB> 43 <TAB> By that, he means low-margin but low-risk products such as certain types of primary property insurance.
43 <TAB> 44 <TAB> The exchange, he says, must find new products and new markets.
44 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That won't be an easy task.
45 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Tradition is dictator at Lloyd's.
46 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Three years ago, the exchange took up residence in a space-age tower of steel and glass -- evocative of the kind of modern architecture that Britain's Prince Charles has denounced. (Some exchange wags call the building "the oil rig.") But along with such treasured artifacts as Lord Nelson's spyglass, Lloyd's also brought its outmoded ways of doing business.
47 <TAB> 48 <TAB> The Lloyd's market actively underwrites insurance just 4 1/2 hours a day, brokers say.
48 <TAB> 49 <TAB> Underwriting doesn't get under way until after morning tea at 10 a.m.
49 <TAB> 50 <TAB> A two-hour lunch break follows.
50 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Things wind down at about 4:30 p.m., just in time for afternoon tea.
51 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Lloyd's vast trading hall houses a warren of well-polished desks.
52 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The hall's few computers are used mostly to send messages.
53 <TAB> 54 <TAB> Sandwiched between desks, underwriters sit on benches surrounded by stacks of policies.
54 <TAB> 55 <TAB> Brokers clutching thick folders stand in lines, waiting their turn to speak to the underwriters.
55 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A broker may have to approach as many as 20 underwriters who insure the endeavors on behalf of the syndicates.
56 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It could take six months for a claim to be paid.
57 <TAB> 58 <TAB> "The system," says Nicholas Samengo-Turner, a Lloyd's broker who left the exchange in 1985, "is so ludicrously unprofessional it drives you mad."
58 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Some maintain underwriters also have been inept.
59 <TAB> -1 <TAB> John Wetherell, a Lloyd's underwriter, says he and his fellow underwriters underestimated by as much as 50% the premiums they should have charged for property risks from 1980 to 1985. "How unprofessional we must have appeared to the outside world -- how incompetent at risk assessment and evaluation," he says.
60 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Lloyd's officials decline to comment on the matter.
61 <TAB> -1 <TAB> More recently, property rates have increased.
62 <TAB> 63 <TAB> Many at Lloyd's expect the San Francisco earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further.
63 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But it will be years before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters.
64 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The magnitude of the exchange's problems may not become known for some time because of Lloyd's practice of leaving the books open for three years to allow for the settlement of claims.
65 <TAB> 66 <TAB> Lloyd's only recently reported its financial results for 1986.
66 <TAB> 67 <TAB> That year, it posted record pretax profit of #650 million, a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims.
67 <TAB> 68 <TAB> But Mr. Lawrence says reported profit will be down in 1987, 1988 and 1989, though he declines to specify how steep the decline will be.
68 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Insurance analysts say the exchange's downturn in profitability is likely to be aggravated by more than $600 million in aviation losses (including the 1988 Pan Am airline disaster over Lockerbie, Scotland) and a still-uncalculated chunk of claims from September's Hurricane Hugo.
69 <TAB> 70 <TAB> Lloyd's says the departures of names isn't likely to hurt its underwriting capacity, currently about #11 billion.
70 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Lawrence says the drain of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names.
71 <TAB> 72 <TAB> Meanwhile, the exchange has been trying to lower costs. (It recently cut its work force by 9%, or 213.)
72 <TAB> 73 <TAB> But Lloyd's is hampered in its efforts to overhaul operations by its reluctance to embrace modern technology.
73 <TAB> 74 <TAB> Mr. Wetherell, the underwriter, reckons half of his business could be transacted by computer, cutting costs at least 10%.
74 <TAB> 75 <TAB> Though Lloyd's has talked for years about computerizing underwriting transactions, the effort hasn't gotten very far.
75 <TAB> 76 <TAB> Competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath to centralize price and policy information.
76 <TAB> 77 <TAB> Both groups cling to traditional face-to-face dealings, even for routine policies.
77 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Lloyd's overblown bureaucracy also hampers efforts to update marketing strategies.
78 <TAB> 79 <TAB> Some underwriters have been pressing for years to tap the low-margin business by selling some policies directly to consumers.
79 <TAB> 81 <TAB> Lloyd's presently sells only auto insurance directly to the public, and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the U.K. and Canada.
80 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But such changes must be cleared by four internal committees and dozens of underwriters, brokers and administrators before being implemented.
81 <TAB> 82 <TAB> The proposal to sell directly to the public remains mired in bureaucratic quicksand.
82 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Lloyd's is moving forward on some fronts, though.
83 <TAB> 84 <TAB> Mr. Lawrence says the exchange is updating some procedures to make speedier payments on claims.
84 <TAB> -1 <TAB> By next year, all underwriters will be linked to a communications network that could reduce paper work on claims.

0 <TAB> 2 <TAB> This hasn't been Kellogg Co. 's year.
1 <TAB> 6 <TAB> The oat-bran craze has cost the world's largest cereal maker market share.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> The company's president quit suddenly.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> And now Kellogg is indefinitely suspending work on what was to be a $1 billion cereal plant.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> The company said it was delaying construction because of current market conditions.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But the Memphis, Tenn., facility wasn't to begin turning out product until 1993, so the decision may reveal a more pessimistic long-term outlook as well.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Kellogg, which hasn't been as successful in capitalizing on the public's health-oriented desire for oat bran as rival General Mills Inc., has been losing share in the $6 billion ready-to-eat cereal market.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Kellogg's current share is believed to be slightly under 40% while General Mills' share is about 27%.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Led by its oat-based Cheerios line, General Mills has gained an estimated 2% share so far this year, mostly at the expense of Kellogg.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Each share point is worth about $60 million in sales.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Analysts say much of Kellogg's erosion has been in such core brands as Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies and Frosted Flakes, which represent nearly one-third of its sales volume.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Kellogg is so anxious to turn around Corn Flakes sales that it soon will begin selling boxes for as little as 99 cents, trade sources say.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios have eaten away sales normally going to Kellogg's corn-based lines simply because they are made of oats," says Merrill Lynch food analyst William Maguire. "They are not a happy group of people at Battle Creek right now." Kellogg is based in Battle Creek, Mich., a city that calls itself the breakfast capital of the world.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Another analyst, John C. Maxwell Jr. of Wheat, First Securities in Richmond, Va., recently went to a "sell" recommendation on Kellogg stock, which closed Friday at $71.75, down 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. "I don't think Kellogg can get back to 40% this year," he said. "Kellogg's main problem is life style.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> People are reading the boxes and deciding they want something that's `healthy' for you -- oats, bran." Mr. Maxwell said he wouldn't be surprised if, over the next two years or so, General Mills' share increased to 30% or more.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In announcing the plant delay, Kellogg Chairman William E. LaMothe said, "Cereal volume growth in the U.S. has not met our expectations for 1989." He said construction wouldn't resume until market conditions warrant it.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Kellogg indicated that it has room to grow without adding facilities.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The company has five other U.S. plants, including a modern facility at its Battle Creek headquarters known as Building 100, which is to add bran-processing and rice-processing capacity next year.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> General Mills, meanwhile, finds itself constrained from boosting sales further because its plants are operating at capacity.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A large plant in Covington, Ga., is to come on line next year.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> A Kellogg officer, who asked not to be named, said the Memphis project was "pulled in for a reconsideration of costs," an indication that the ambitious plans might be scaled back in any future construction.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Initial cost estimates for the plant, which was to have been built in phases, ranged from $1 billion to $1.2 billion.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> A company spokesman said it was "possible, but highly unlikely," that the plant might never be built. "As we regain our leadership level where we have been, and as we continue to put new products into the marketplace and need additional capacity, we will look at resuming our involvement with our plan," he said.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The new facility was to have been the world's most advanced cereal manufacturing plant, and Kellogg's largest construction project.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> The company had retained the Fluor Daniel unit of Fluor Corp. as general contractor.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> But in recent weeks, construction-industry sources reported that early preparation work was slowing at the 185-acre site.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> Subcontractors said they were told that equipment orders would be delayed.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Fluor Daniel already has reassigned most of its work crew, the sources said.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> Last Friday's announcement was the first official word that the project was in trouble and that the company's plans for a surge in market share may have been overly optimistic.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> Until recently, Kellogg had been telling its sales force and Wall Street that by 1992 it intended to achieve a 50% share of market, measured in dollar volume.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> Although he called current market conditions "highly competitive," Mr. LaMothe, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive officer, forecast an earnings increase for the full year.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Last year, the company earned $480.4 million, or $3.90 a share, on sales of $4.3 billion.
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> As expected, Kellogg reported lower third-quarter earnings.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> Net fell 16% to $123.1 million, or $1.02 a share, from $145.7 million, or $1.18 a share.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Sales rose 4.8% to $1.20 billion from $1.14 billion.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The company had a one-time charge of $14.8 million in the latest quarter covering the disposition of certain assets.

5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Although Exxon spent heavily during the latest quarter to clean up the Alaskan shoreline blackened by its huge oil spill, those expenses as well as the cost of a continuing spill-related program are covered by $880 million in charges taken during the first half.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> An Exxon official said that at this time the oil company doesn't anticipate any additional charges to future earnings relating to the cleanup of oil spilled when one of its tankers rammed into an underwater reef.

12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Exxon's profitability, like that of many other oil companies, was hurt during the third quarter by declining returns from the chemicals and refining and marketing businesses.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Exxon's earnings from chemicals operations fell $90 million, to $254 million, while refining and marketing profits declined $180 million, to $357 million.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Although crude oil prices were significantly higher this year, they weren't strong enough to offset the declining profits in those business sectors at most oil companies, said William Randol, oil analyst for First Boston Corp.

5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But because first-quarter demand is normally the weakest of the year, several market participants say, OPEC production will have to decline to keep prices from eroding further.

7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> With prices already headed lower, news of a series of explosions at a major Phillips Petroleum Co. chemical facility on the Houston Ship Channel also was bearish for prices.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Even though such facilities use a relatively small amount of crude, analysts say, now the facility won't need any, at a time of already high availability.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> The Phillips plant makes polyethylene, polypropylene and other plastic products.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> A company official said the explosions began when a seal blew out.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Dozens of workers were injured, authorities said.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> There was no immediate estimate of damage from the company.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Some petroleum futures traders say technical considerations now will help to put downward pressure on futures prices.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For instance, one trader said that prices inevitably will go lower now that they've fallen below $20 a barrel. "Our technician is a little bearish now that we've taken out $20," he said.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> In other commodity markets yesterday:
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> COPPER: The selling that started on Friday continued yesterday.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> The December contract fell 3.85 cents a pound to $1.1960.
18 <TAB> 25 <TAB> London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks were down only 4,800 metric tons for the week to 84,500 tons; expectations late last week were a drop of 10,000 to 15,000 tons.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> The New York market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $1.23-a-pound level, selling picked up as previous buyers bailed out of their positions and aggressive short sellers -- anticipating further declines -- moved in.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Fund selling also picked up at that point.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> According to Bernard Savaiko, senior commodity analyst at PaineWebber, the only stability to the market came when short sellers periodically moved in to cover their positions by buying contracts.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> This activity produced small rallies, which in turn attracted new short selling.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> Mr. Savaiko noted that copper had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar, which would normally support the U.S. copper market.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Such support usually comes from arbitragers who use a strong British pound to buy copper in New York. "The sell-off would probably have been worse if the dollar had been strong," he said.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> Copper has been stuck in a trading range of $1.19 to $1.34.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Savaiko believes that if copper falls below the bottom of this range the next significant support level will be about $1.04.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> PRECIOUS METALS: Platinum and palladium struggled to maintain their prices all day despite news stories over the weekend that recent cold fusion experiments, which use both metals, showed signs of producing extra heat.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> January platinum closed down $2.80 an ounce at $486.30, nearly $4 above its low for the day.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> December palladium was off $1.55 an ounce at $137.20.
30 <TAB> 35 <TAB> Platinum is believed to have good support around $480 and palladium at around $130.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> Some traders were thought to be waiting for the auto sales report, which will be released today.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Such sales are watched closely by platinum and palladium traders because both metals are used in automobile catalytic converters.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> Mr. Savaiko theorized that the news on cold fusion didn't affect the market yesterday because many traders have already been badly burnt by such stories.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He said the traders are demanding a higher level of proof before they will buy palladium again.
35 <TAB> 36 <TAB> Also weighing on both metals' prices is the role of the chief supplier, the Soviet Union.
36 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Many analysts believe that the Soviets' thirst for dollars this year to buy grain and other Western commodities and goods will bring them to the market whenever prices rally very much.
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices closed mixed as contracts reacted to largely offsetting bullish and bearish news.
38 <TAB> 39 <TAB> On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for November delivery closed at $5.63 a bushel, down half a cent, while the December wheat contract rose three-quarters of a cent to $4.0775 a bushel.
39 <TAB> 40 <TAB> Supporting prices was the announcement late Friday of additional grain sales to the Soviet Union.
40 <TAB> 41 <TAB> But acting as a drag on prices was the improved harvest weather over the weekend and the prospect for continued fair weather this week over much of the Farm Belt.
41 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Strong farmer selling over the weekend also weighed on prices.
42 <TAB> 43 <TAB> SUGAR: World prices tumbled, mostly from their own weight, according to analysts.
43 <TAB> 44 <TAB> The March contract ended at 13.79 cents a pound, down 0.37 cent.
44 <TAB> 46 <TAB> For the past week or so, traders have been expecting India to buy between 150,000 and 200,000 tons of refined sugar, and there have been expectations of a major purchase by Japan.
45 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But with no reports of either country actually entering the market, analysts said, futures prices became vulnerable.
46 <TAB> 47 <TAB> Developing countries such as India, some analysts said, seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range, around 14.75 cents, and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range, around 13.50 cents.
47 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But Erik Dunlaevy, a sugar analyst with Balfour Maclaine International Ltd., said the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler: Speculators, he said, "got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs." A PaineWebber analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption, sugar isn't likely to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country.
48 <TAB> 49 <TAB> COCOA: Futures rallied modestly.
49 <TAB> 50 <TAB> The December contract rose $33 a metric ton to $1,027, near its high for the day.
50 <TAB> 52 <TAB> Gill & Duffus Ltd., a British cocoa-trading house, estimated that the 1989-90 world cocoa surplus would be 231,000 tons, down from 314,000 tons for the previous year.
51 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Market technicians were encouraged by the price patterns, which in the past have preceded sharp rallies.
52 <TAB> 53 <TAB> Recent prices for cocoa have been near levels last seen in the mid-1970s.
53 <TAB> 54 <TAB> At such prices, according to Mr. Savaiko, bargain hunting and short-covering -- buying back of contracts previously sold -- by speculators isn't uncommon.
54 <TAB> 55 <TAB> But Mr. Savaiko expects stepped-up producer selling at around the $1,040 to $1,050 level.
55 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He also noted that a strong sterling market yesterday might have helped cocoa in New York as arbitragers took advantage of the currency move.
56 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Sandra Kaul, research analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said the market pushed higher mainly in anticipation of a late harvest in the Ivory Coast, a major cocoa producer.

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It was the kind of snubbing rarely seen within the Congress, let alone within the same party.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Sen. Alan Cranston trekked over to the House side of Capitol Hill a few days ago and volunteered his testimony to fellow Democrat Rep. Henry Gonzalez.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> It was offered as an expression of cooperation to Mr. Gonzalez, who is investigating the $2.5 billion failure of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But instead of thanks, Sen. Cranston was treated with cool formality. "Every witness receives a formal subpoena," Rep. Gonzalez told him.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Seldom have House hearings caused so much apprehension in the Senate, where California Sen. Cranston and four other senators were already writhing in the glare of unfavorable publicity over the alleged looting of Lincoln by their friend and political benefactor, Charles Keating Jr., principal stockholder of Lincoln's parent company, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, Ariz.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> At the first day of the House Banking Committee's hearings last week, William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency created to sell sick thrifts, said the agency is investigating whether Lincoln made illegal political contributions.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Mr. Keating arranged nearly $1 million in donations to Sen. Cranston and his various political causes, and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Future witnesses include a former federal S&L regulator who has accused the five senators of attempting to "subvert" the regulatory process by intervening on behalf of Mr. Keating.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Unlike many lawmakers, Chairman Gonzalez says he considers intervening with regulators to be improper. "When you reach a point where a policy-making body is trying to shape administrative decisions, then that's a no-no in my book," the Texas lawmaker says.
9 <TAB> 12 <TAB> And he has attached himself to the Lincoln story tenaciously. "Unless the questions are answered, I will keep on going."
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Lawmakers often are reluctant to embarrass colleagues, even those of opposing political parties.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In the recent Housing and Urban Development Department scandal, for example, Rep. Thomas Lantos, the California Democrat who led the hearings, tiptoed through embarrassing disclosures about HUD grants secured by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a New York Republican.
12 <TAB> 14 <TAB> But Chairman Gonzalez is a genuine maverick.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He comes from the same political line as Wright Patman, a bank-baiting Texas populist who chaired the Banking Committee until 1974.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Gonzalez is also a stickler for ethical standards who refuses to accept honorariums and who believes in conducting official business in the open.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Early in his political career, as a city councilman in San Antonio, he walked out of a meeting when political supporters asked that the police chief be replaced, denouncing the closed-door affair publicly as a "bat-roost meeting."
16 <TAB> 18 <TAB> The immediate target of Rep. Gonzalez's inquiry is Danny Wall, chairman of the Office of Thrift Supervision.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> As the principal regulator of the thrift industry, Mr. Wall delayed seizing Lincoln S&L for more than two years after his staff told him that the California thrift was insolvent and that potential losses to taxpayers were growing rapidly.
18 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Rep. Gonzalez seems primed to lash out at Mr. Wall when hearings resume Thursday with testimony by two federal regulators from San Francisco, William Black and Mike Patriarca.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Wall relieved them of responsibility for supervising Lincoln in 1988.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Gonzalez expressed concern over a report that the two had been summoned to Washington by Mr. Wall last week to discuss their testimony in advance. "I think he is trying to improperly influence a witness, and by God I'm not going to tolerate it," he says.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Wall, however, is a self-proclaimed "child of the Senate" and former staff director of its Banking Committee.
22 <TAB> 24 <TAB> An inquiry into his handling of Lincoln S&L inevitably will drag in Sen. Cranston and the four others, Sens.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), John McCain (R., Ariz.), John Glenn (D., Ohio) and Donald Riegle (D., Mich.).
24 <TAB> 26 <TAB> They all attended a meeting in April 1987 questioning why a federal audit of Lincoln S&L had dragged on for two years. "I'm certain that in the course of the hearings the names {of the senators} will be brought out," Mr. Gonzalez says.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This is raising eyebrows. "When I first got a glimpse at the witness list, I couldn't believe that they were going to go ahead and do this," says Michael Waldman, director of Congress Watch, a consumer group. "There are some witnesses who will be forced to testify about their meetings with senators."
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And a Democratic aide to a Banking Committee member remarks, "I too am astounded by it, because Gonzalez has certainly placed a lot of Democratic senators in a very bad position."
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> All the senators say they merely were trying to ensure fairness for a constituent.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Keating lives in Phoenix, and the California thrift's parent is an Ohio-chartered corporation with holdings in Michigan.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> Chairman Gonzalez expresses sympathy for Sen. Riegle, his counterpart as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. "He's wise, he's good and I know he's an honest man," the Texan says.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But at the same time, Mr. Gonzalez hasn't forgotten a confrontation over Mr. Wall during House-Senate negotiations over S&L bailout legislation during the summer.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Senate negotiators included Sens.
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> Cranston and Riegle and Mr. Wall's principal sponsor, Republican Sen. Jake Garn of Utah.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> They were willing to trade important provisions in the bailout legislation to preserve Mr. Wall's job and to avoid a reconfirmation hearing in which he would be called upon to testify about Lincoln S&L.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Most importantly, the Senate traded away the Bush administration's controversial plan to finance the bailout, which was partly reinstated later.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> At the time, Mr. Gonzalez said several senators told him that they "could get some roadblocks out of the way if there could be some understanding on Garn's insistence on Wall." Now Mr. Gonzalez is holding the equivalent of reconfirmation hearings anyway, under the guise of the Lincoln investigation. "In a way, that's what this is," Mr. Gonzalez concedes.
36 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Even some House Banking Committee members could suffer from the fallout.
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> Mr. Keating raised $20,000 for Rep. Doug Barnard's 1986 re-election campaign while the Georgia Democrat was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit brokering.
38 <TAB> 39 <TAB> He recently voted "present" when the committee authorized a subpoena to compel Mr. Keating to testify, then changed his vote to yes.
39 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But the chairman's supporters have the upper hand as federal regulators press a $1.1 billion fraud suit against Mr. Keating and others.
40 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Rep. Jim Leach (R., Iowa) says the Lincoln S&L affair is "the biggest bank heist in history," and adds: "The great question that remains to be resolved is whether we have a congressional Watergate in the making."
41 <TAB> 42 <TAB> A witness set to testify on Thursday was quoted in a news report over the weekend as saying Lincoln "laundered" campaign contributions illegally.
42 <TAB> 43 <TAB> But the witness, William Crawford, California's chief state thrift regulator, denies saying that. "I don't know whether it was done properly or not, because I'm not a lawyer," he said in a telephone interview yesterday.
43 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But he said he is prepared to testify that executives of Lincoln and its parent corporation got unusually high salaries and frequent calls directing them to make specific contributions.
44 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The committee also has summoned Mr. Wall's predecessor, Edwin Gray.
45 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He has characterized the five senators' roles as "tantamount to an attempt to subvert the . . . regulatory process," and he isn't expected to back down even though the five senators have disputed his account of a 1987 meeting.
46 <TAB> -1 <TAB> So the senators must brace themselves.
47 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Sen. Cranston, as he returned to the capital last week from a one-day trip to inspect earthquake damage in San Francisco, sighed to an aide: "Well, back to Keatingland."

3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> In Japanese firms, the president usually is in charge of day-to-day operations, while the chairman's role is more a ceremonial one.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The title of chief executive officer isn't used.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> While people within Daiwa, particularly internationalists, expected that Mr. Dozen, 52, would eventually become Daiwa's president, the speed of his promotion surprised many.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> It was only earlier this year that the jovial, easygoing executive -- he likes to joke with Americans about how his name is synonymous with twelve -- was appointed deputy president.
7 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Mr. Dozen is taking over the reins of a securities company that does very well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Daiwa is one of the world's largest securities firms.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> As of March 31, the Daiwa group had shareholder equity of 801.21 billion yen ($5.64 billion).
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> For the six months ended Sept. 30, Daiwa reported unconsolidated (parent company) net income of 79.03 billion yen ($556.5 million) on revenue of 332.38 billion yen ($2.34 billion).
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Both figures were record highs.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Several observers interpreted Mr. Dozen's appointment as an attempt by Daiwa to make its international operations more profitable while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing deregulation of Japan's domestic markets, which should mean increased competition.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> All of Japan's so-called Big Four securities firms -- Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., the world's largest, Nikko Securities Co. Ltd., Yamaichi Securities Co. Ltd. and Daiwa -- have suffered setbacks in their attempts to break into foreign markets.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> While they have moved to the fore in underwriting fixed-income securities in the Eurobond market -- mostly for Japanese firms -- they have been only marginally profitable, if at all, in the U.S.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> American institutional investors have never had a large appetite for Japanese equities.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> And while the Japanese have stepped up their purchases of U.S. shares in the past several months, they have shown themselves in the past to be fickle investors.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> At the same time, Daiwa and its brethren have faced stiff competition from well-entrenched American competitors that have prevented them from building strong links to U.S. corporations and institutional investors.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Dozen knows these problems firsthand.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> When he arrived in the U.S. in 1969 -- the start of an eight-year tour -- he tried selling Japanese yen-denominated bonds to U.S. investors. "He made desperate efforts, using the yellow pages from beginning to end," said Koji Yoneyama, president of Daiwa's U.S. unit. "But not a single piece of paper was sold."
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> By his own account, Mr. Dozen didn't do much better with U.S. bonds.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> In an interview a few months ago, he recalled how after some training at Salomon Brothers Inc., he successfully bid for the opportunity to sell portions of 20 U.S. corporate bond issues.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But he couldn't sell any. "Japanese stock salesmen selling American bonds?
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Maybe it's crazy," he said.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> Mr. Dozen even related the indignity suffered when he and two colleagues went on an overnight fishing expedition off the New Jersey shore and caught nothing.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Upon returning to New York, "Exhausted, I got into a taxicab, and the woman driver said: `Americans make better fishermen, '" he recalled.
26 <TAB> 28 <TAB> Undaunted, Mr. Dozen said that Daiwa's goal is to build "a high-technology oriented international organization with maybe some Japanese flavor to it."
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He said that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures, options, mortgaged-backed securities, computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Dozen said Daiwa's strengths were its large capital base, its influential position in the Tokyo market and its links to Japanese corporations and institutional investors.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> Mr. Dozen joined Daiwa upon his graduation from Kyoto University in 1959.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> Like many young recruits in Japanese securities firms, he began his career peddling stock to individual investors.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> In his climb to the top, Mr. Dozen also headed the company's stock-exchange division, its fixed-income units and its international operations. "He was constantly picking up new things to fill out his experience; he is very well-balanced," said Takuro Isoda, chairman of Daiwa's U.S. unit in New York.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But it Mr. Dozen's experience as a salesman that enabled him to gain the political support -- particularly from the retail sales force -- to accede to the presidency.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Commission income from domestic stock and bond sales accounts form a large portion of Japanese securities companies' earnings.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And anybody who lacked the backing of the retail sales force "would be fragile," said a Daiwa executive.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If Mr. Dozen has a weakness, it may be his golf game. "He digs in the sand instead of hitting the ball, like a farmer," said Mr. Yoneyama.

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> British Aerospace PLC and France's Thomson-CSF S.A. said they are nearing an agreement to merge their guided-missile divisions, greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> The 50-50 joint venture, which may be dubbed Eurodynamics, would have combined annual sales of at least #1.4 billion ($2.17 billion) and would be among the world's largest missile makers.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> After two years of talks, plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek French and British government clearance.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> The companies hope for a final agreement by year-end.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies, and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In recent months, a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have reshaped the once-balkanized world of European arms manufacture.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Already, British Aerospace and French government-controlled Thomson-CSF collaborate on a British missile contract and on an air-traffic control radar system.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy Ferranti International Signal PLC, a smaller British defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The sudden romance of British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF -- traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts -- is stirring controversy in Western Europe's defense industry.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Most threatened by closer British Aerospace-Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals, including Matra S.A. in France and Britain's General Electric Co. PLC.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But neither Matra nor GEC -- unrelated to Stamford, Conn.-based General Electric Co. -- are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Yesterday, a source close to GEC confirmed that his company may join the Ferranti fight, as part of a possible consortium that would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Companies with which GEC has had talks about a possible joint Ferranti bid include Matra, Britain's Dowty Group PLC, West Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, and France's Dassault group.
13 <TAB> 15 <TAB> But it may be weeks before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid, the source indicated.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> GEC plans first to study Ferranti's financial accounts, which auditors recently said included #215 million in fictitious contracts at a U.S. unit, International Signal & Control Group, with which Ferranti merged last year.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Also, any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators; Ferranti is GEC's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts, and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country's defense industry.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> A consortium bid, however, would diminish GEC's direct role in Ferranti and might consequently appease ministry officials.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A British Aerospace spokeswoman appeared unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with GEC for Ferranti: "Competition is the name of the game," she said.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> At least one potential GEC partner, Matra, insists it isn't interested in Ferranti. "We have nothing to say about this affair, which doesn't concern us," a Matra official said Sunday.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The missile venture, the British Aerospace spokeswoman said, is a needed response to the "new environment" in defense contracting.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For both Thomson and British Aerospace, earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries; and Middle East sales, a traditional mainstay for both companies' exports, have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> The venture's importance for Thomson is great.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The European defense industry is consolidating; for instance, West Germany's Siemens AG recently joined GEC in a takeover of Britain's Plessey Co., and Daimler-Benz agreed to buy Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b.

25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> In missiles, Thomson is already overshadowed by British Aerospace and by its home rival, France's Aerospatiale S.A.; to better compete, Thomson officials say, they need a partnership.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> To justify 50-50 ownership of the planned venture, Thomson would make a cash payment to British Aerospace.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> Annual revenue of British Aerospace's missile business is about #950 million, a Thomson spokesman said.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> British Aerospace's chief missile products include its 17-year-old family of Rapier surface-to-air missiles.

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Few people are aware that the federal government lends almost as much money as it borrows.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> From 1980 to 1988, while federal budget deficits totaled $1.41 trillion, the government issued $394 billion of new direct loans and an additional $756 billion of new primary loan guarantees.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> These figures omit secondary guarantees, deposit insurance, and the activities of Government-Sponsored Enterprises (a huge concern in its own right, as detailed on this page May 3).
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Federal credit programs date back to the New Deal, and were meant to break even financially.
4 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Since the 1950s, federal lending has experienced extraordinary growth in credit volume, subsidy rates, and policy applications, spurred on by the growth of government in general and budget gimmicks and deceptive management in particular.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> As we will see, many of these obligations don't show up as part of the federal deficit.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But recent events indicate that federal credit is out of control.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Student loan defaults remain high at about 12%, and the program has been rocked by allegations of fraud and mismanagement.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) loans have turned into de facto giveaway programs; losses over the next three years are expected to exceed $20 billion.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Defaults on Veterans Affairs loan guarantees have quadrupled in the past eight years.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Last month, the General Accounting Office reported that defaults in Federal Housing Administration guarantees were five times as high as previously estimated, and that FHA's equity fell to minus $2.9 billion.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> GAO's findings are particularly troubling because the FHA has about $300 billion in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Scores of other credit programs, subsidizing agriculture, small business, exporters, defense, energy, transportation and others, are less visible but in no better shape.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If the programs continue their present path, the potential government losses are staggering: The federal government holds $222 billion in direct loans outstanding and backs an additional $550 billion in primary guarantees. (Secondary guarantees of pools of FHA- and VA-backed loans by the agency known as Ginnie Mae currently exceed $330 billion.)
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Although external events have contributed to the morass, the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> To reduce the risks while still retaining the legitimate benefits these programs can provide, credit policy must:
16 <TAB> 34 <TAB> 1.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Use credit to improve the operation of capital markets, not to provide subsidies.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> There is a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and maintaining the integrity of a credit program.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> If the program is meant to provide a subsidy, collecting the debt defeats the original goal.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Thus, subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs, with increasing subsidy and default rates over time.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> To avoid this problem, government should issue credit only if it intends to use every legal method to collect.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In contrast, credit programs can be appropriate tools to improve the operation of capital markets.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For example, legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a reliable flow of lendable funds.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> However, this in no way justifies the huge government subsidies and losses on such loans.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Credit policy should separate these two competing objectives and eliminate aspects that provide the subsidy.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> For example, student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and mitigate problems created by the fact that students' future earnings are not accepted as collateral.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> The program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount.
29 <TAB> 31 <TAB> High default rates, a low interest rate, and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Families that do not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> In contrast, a student loan program that was meant solely to correct capital-market imperfections would allow loans for any student, regardless of family income, at market or near-market rates.
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> While the student was in school, interest costs would either be paid by the student or added to the loan balance.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This program, combined with cash grants to needy students, would reduce program costs and much more effectively target the intended beneficiaries.
34 <TAB> 46 <TAB> 2.
35 <TAB> 41 <TAB> Provide better incentives.
36 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Given the structure of most credit programs, it is surprising that default rates are not even higher.
37 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Guarantee rates are typically 100%, giving lenders little reason to screen customers carefully.
38 <TAB> 39 <TAB> Reducing those rates moderately (say, to 75%) would still provide substantial assistance to borrowers.
39 <TAB> 40 <TAB> But it would also encourage lenders to choose more creditworthy customers, and go a long way toward reducing defaults.
40 <TAB> 49 <TAB> For example, the Small Business Administration has had reasonable success in reducing both guarantee rates and default rates in its Preferred Lenders' Program.
41 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Borrowers' incentives are equally skewed.
42 <TAB> 43 <TAB> Since the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts, the costs to the borrower of defaulting are usually low.
43 <TAB> 44 <TAB> In addition, it is often possible to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts are not paid off.
44 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Simple policy prescriptions in this case would be to improve debt collection (taking the gloves off contracted collection agencies) and to deny new credit to defaulters.
45 <TAB> -1 <TAB> These provisions would be difficult to enforce for a program intended to provide a subsidy, but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that attempt to offset market imperfections.
46 <TAB> 56 <TAB> 3.
47 <TAB> 52 <TAB> Record the true costs of credit programs in the federal budget.
48 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Since the budget measures cash flow, a new $1 direct loan is treated as a $1 expenditure, even though at least part of the loan will be paid back.
49 <TAB> 50 <TAB> Loan guarantees don't appear at all until the borrower defaults, so new guarantees do not raise the deficit, even though they create future liabilities for the government.
50 <TAB> 55 <TAB> By converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee, the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit.
51 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Predictably, guarantees outstanding have risen by $130 billion since 1985, while direct loans outstanding have fallen by $30 billion.
52 <TAB> 53 <TAB> The true budgetary cost of a credit subsidy is the discounted value of the net costs to government.
53 <TAB> 54 <TAB> This figure could be estimated using techniques employed by private lenders to forecast losses, or determined by selling loans to private owners (without federal guarantees).
54 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Neither technique is perfect, but both are better than the current system, which misstates the costs of new credit programs by amounts that vary substantially and average about $20 billion annually, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
55 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A budget that reflected the real costs of lending would eliminate incentives to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees and would let taxpayers know what Congress is committing them to.
56 <TAB> -1 <TAB> 4.
57 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Impose standard accounting and administrative practices.
58 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Creative accounting is a hallmark of federal credit.
59 <TAB> 60 <TAB> Many agencies roll over their debt, paying off delinquent loans by issuing new loans, or converting defaulted loan guarantees into direct loans.
60 <TAB> 61 <TAB> In any case, they avoid having to write off the loans.
61 <TAB> 62 <TAB> Some agencies simply keep bad loans on the books; as late as 1987, the Export-Import Bank held in its portfolio at face value loans made to Cuba in the 1950s.
62 <TAB> -1 <TAB> More seriously, FmHA has carried several billion dollars of defaulted loans at face value.
63 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Until GAO's recent audit, FHA books had not been subject to a complete external audit in 15 years.
64 <TAB> 65 <TAB> The administration of federal credit should closely parallel private lending practices, including the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside audits.
65 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Establishing these practices would permit earlier identification of emerging financial crises, provide better information for loan sales and budgeting decisions, and reduce fraud.
66 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Government lending was not intended to be a way to obfuscate spending figures, hide fraudulent activity, or provide large subsidies.
67 <TAB> 68 <TAB> The reforms described above would provide a more limited, but clearer, safer and ultimately more useful role for government as a lender.
68 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Without such reforms, credit programs will continue to be a large-scale, high-risk proposition for taxpayers.

21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Maybe it's not that simple.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For starters, racehorse buyers have to remember the basic problem of such ventures: These beasts don't come with warranties.

24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> Katherine Voss, a veteran trainer at the Laurel, Md., track, offers neophytes a sobering tour of a horse barn, noting that only three of about a dozen horses have won sizable purses.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> One brown two-year-old filly was wheezing from a cold, while another had splints on its legs, keeping both animals from the racetrack. "You can see the highs and lows of the business all under one roof," she tells the group. "There aren't too many winners."
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Perhaps the biggest hurdle owners face is convincing newcomers that this is a reputable business.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> Some badly managed partnerships have burned investors, sometimes after they received advice from industry "consultants." So owners have developed a "code of ethics," outlining rules for consultants and agents, and disclosure of fees and any conflicts of interest.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But some are skeptical of the code's effectiveness. "The industry is based on individual honesty," says Cap Hershey, a Lexington horse farmer and one of the investors who bought Spendthrift.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> Despite the drop in prices for thoroughbreds, owning one still isn't cheap.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> At the low end, investors can spend $15,000 or more to own a racehorse in partnership with others.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> At a yearling sale, a buyer can go solo and get a horse for a few thousand dollars.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But that means paying the horse's maintenance; on average, it costs $25,000 a year to raise a horse.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For those looking for something between a minority stake and total ownership, the owners' group is considering a special sale where established horse breeders would sell a 50% stake in horses to newcomers.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Time Warner Inc. is considering a legal challenge to Tele-Communications Inc. 's plan to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc., a move that could lead to all-out war between the cable industry's two most powerful players.
1 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Time is also fighting the transaction on other fronts, by attempting to discourage other cable operators from joining Tele-Communications as investors in Showtime, cable-TV industry executives say.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Time officials declined to comment.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> Last week, Tele-Communications agreed to pay Viacom Inc. $225 million for a 50% stake in its Showtime subsidiary, which is a distant second to Time's Home Box Office in the delivery of pay-TV networks to cable subscribers.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Tele-Communications, the U.S.'s largest cable company, said it may seek other cable partners to join in its investment.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Tele-Communications is HBO's largest customer, and the two have a number of other business relationships.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Earlier this year, Time even discussed bringing Tele-Communications in as an investor in HBO, executives at both companies said.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> The purchase of the Showtime stake is "a direct slap in our face," said one senior Time executive.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Time is expected to mount a legal challenge in U.S. District Court in New York, where Viacom in May filed a $2.5 billion antitrust suit charging Time and HBO with monopolizing the pay-TV business and trying to crush competition from Showtime.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Executives involved in plotting Time's defense say it is now preparing a countersuit naming both Viacom and Tele-Communications as defendants.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The executives say Time may seek to break up the transaction after it is consummated, or may seek constraints that would prevent Tele-Communications from dropping HBO in any of its cable systems in favor of Showtime.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Viacom officials declined to comment.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Jerome Kern, Tele-Communications' chief outside counsel, said he wasn't aware of Time's legal plans.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But he said that any effort by Time to characterize the Tele-Communications investment in Showtime as anti-competitive would be "the pot calling the kettle black."
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "It's hard to see how an investment by the largest {cable operator} in the weaker of the two networks is anti-competitive, when the stronger of the two networks is owned by the second largest" cable operator, Mr. Kern said.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In addition to owning HBO, with 22 million subscribers, Time Warner separately operates cable-TV system serving about 5.6 million cable-TV subscribers.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Tele-Communications controls close to 12 million cable subscribers, and Viacom has about one million.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> In its suit against Time, Viacom says the ownership of both cable systems and cable-programming networks gives the company too much market power.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> Time argues that in joining up with Tele-Communications, Viacom has potentially more power, particularly since Viacom also owns cable networks MTV, VH-1 and Nick at Nite.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Ironically, Tele-Communications and Time have often worked closely in the cable business.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Together, they control nearly 40% of Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc.; Tele-Communications has a 21.8% stake, while Time Warner has a 17.8% stake.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> But since Time's merger with Warner Communications Inc., relations between the two have become strained.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too vertically integrated.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> Meanwhile, some legal observers say the Tele-Communications investment and other developments are weakening Viacom's antitrust suit against Time.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> Viacom accuses Time in its suit of refusing to carry Showtime or a sister service, The Movie Channel, on Time's Manhattan Cable TV system, one of the nation's largest urban systems.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But yesterday, Manhattan Cable announced it will launch Showtime on Nov. 1 to over 230,000 subscribers.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> Showtime has also accused HBO of locking up the lion's share of Hollywood's movies by signing exclusive contracts with all the major studios.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But Showtime has continued to sign new contracts with Hollywood studios, and yesterday announced it will buy movies from Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., which currently has a non-exclusive arrangement with HBO.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden, a great zoo, its own charming Little Italy (on Arthur Avenue) and, of course, the Yankees.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> However, most people, having been subjected to news footage of the devastated South Bronx, look at the borough the way Tom Wolfe's Sherman McCoy did in "Bonfire of the Vanities" -- as a wrong turn into hell.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> But Laura Cunningham's Bronx, her childhood Bronx of the '50s, is something else altogether.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In a lovely, novelistic memoir, "Sleeping Arrangements" (Knopf, 195 pages, $18.95), she remembers an exotic playground, peopled mainly by Jewish eccentrics and the occasional Catholic (real oddballs like her sexpot friend, the hell-kitten Diana, age five).
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Ms. Cunningham, a novelist and playwright, has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> She transforms her "Bronx of the emotions, a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria" into the "Babylonian Bronx," a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In the Babylonian Bronx, Jewish working-class people lived in drab, Soviet-style buildings "glamorized" with names like AnaMor Towers (after owners Anna and Morris Snezak), whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks, friezes of Pompeii.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> For Ms. Cunningham the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy she felt living in the AnaMor Towers as a little girl: ". . . outwardly ordinary, inwardly ornate, owing all inspiration to heathen cultures." Sharp-witted and funny but never mean, she's a memorialist a bit like Truman Capote, if he'd been Jewish and female and less bitchy.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Little Lily, as Ms. Cunningham calls herself in the book, really wasn't ordinary.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> She was raised, for the first eight years, by her mother, Rosie, whom she remembers as a loving liar, who realigned history to explain why Lily's father didn't live with them.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Rosie reinvented this man, who may or may not have known about his child, as a war hero for Lily's benefit.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Rosie died young and Lily has remembered her as a romantic figure, who didn't interfere much with her child's education on the streets.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The games Bronx children played (holding kids down and stripping them, for example) seem tame by today's crack standards, but Ms. Cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure. "Without official knowledge of sex or death, we flirted with both," she writes.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> She analyzed families by their sleeping arrangements.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Her friend Susan, whose parents kept reminding her she was unwanted, slept on a narrow bed wedged into her parents' bedroom, as though she were a temporary visitor.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Her friend Diana's father was a professional thief; they didn't seem to have any bedrooms at all.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Maybe Lily became so obsessed with where people slept and how because her own arrangements kept shifting.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> When Rosie died, her uncles moved in -- and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> They painted the apartment orange, pink and white, according to her instructions.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> With loving detail she recalls her Uncle Gabe, an Orthodox Jew and song lyricist (who rhymed river with liver in a love song); and Uncle Len, a mysterious part-time investigator who looked like Lincoln and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope, like an "undercover President on a good-will mission."
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They came by their strangeness honestly.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Lily's grandmother, no cookie baker, excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album, and lugged around her perennial work-in-progress, "Philosophy for Women."
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The book loses some momentum toward the end, when Lily becomes more preoccupied with dating boys and less with her delightfully weird family.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For the most part, though, there's much pleasure in her saucy, poignant probe into the mysteries of the Babylonian Bronx.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Bronx also figures in Bruce Jay Friedman's latest novel, which flashes back to the New York of the '50s.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But both the past and present worlds of "The Current Climate" (Atlantic Monthly Press, 200 pages, $18.95) feel cramped and static.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> For his sixth novel, Mr. Friedman tried to resuscitate the protagonist of his 1972 work, "About Harry Towns." Harry is now a 57-year-old writer, whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in Hollywood and New York seems quaintly out-of-synch.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Harry fondly remembers the "old" days of the early '70s, when people like his friend Travis would take a psychiatrist on a date to analyze what Travis was doing wrong. "An L.A. solution," explains Mr. Friedman.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Line by line Mr. Friedman's weary cynicism can be amusing, especially when he's riffing on the Hollywood social scheme -- the way people size each other up, immediately canceling the desperate ones who merely almost made it.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> Harry has avoided all that by living in a Long Island suburb with his wife, who's so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels she barely seems to notice when her husband disappears for drug-seeking forays into Manhattan.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But it doesn't take too many lines to figure Harry out.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He's a bore.

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In a sign the stock slump hasn't quieted Europe's takeover fever, Cie.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Financiere de Paribas said it intends to bid for one of France's other large financial and industrial holding companies, Cie. de Navigation Mixte.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Paribas said that once it receives the go-ahead from French stock market authorities, it will offer to boost its Navigation Mixte stake to 66.7% from the current 18.7%.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> Its cash-or-shares bid values Navigation Mixte at about 22.82 billion francs ($3.62 billion), making this one of France's largest-ever attempted takeovers.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> The cost of buying the additional 48% stake would be 10.95 billion francs ($1.74 billion).
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> The move would greatly boost Paribas's stake in the insurance, transport and food businesses, where Navigation Mixte is strong.
6 <TAB> 11 <TAB> It also would make Paribas a major French ally of West Germany's Allianz AG insurance group.
7 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Allianz holds a 50% stake in Navigation Mixte's insurance interests, acquired three weeks ago.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Those include Rhin et Moselle Vie and Via Assurances.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Long considered a potential takeover target, Navigation Mixte had hoped Allianz would help protect it from raiders.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That idea may have backfired.
11 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Paribas is Allianz's main French bank, and the Munich-based group said it intends to stay neutral.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Navigation Mixte said it wouldn't have any comment until its board meets Wednesday.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But Navigation Mixte is loosely held and hard to defend. "The defensive options are limited," says Philippe Braye, a partner in portfolio management concern France Finance Quatre. "Who would bid against Paribas?"
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> If the Paribas bid succeeds, it will be the second time in two months a big French investment banking group has snapped up an insurance group.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Last month, Paribas's archrival, Cie.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Financiere de Suez, won a battle for Groupe Victoire, France's second-largest private-sector insurer, which itself had just acquired West Germany's Colonia Versicherung AG.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> That complex bid was billed as France's largest takeover ever (this one is slightly smaller).
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> Moreover, Suez had just finished winning an even larger battle last year for control of Societe Generale de Belgique.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Paribas officials, once considered France's toughest bankers, felt abashed at Suez's success and its rapid growth.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Although Paribas denies it, analysts say the new bid in part simply reflects the continuing rivalry between France's two largest investment banking groups.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It also reflects the broader pressure on companies in Europe to keep up as the European Community prepares to reduce internal trade barriers by 1992.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Although Paribas Chairman Michel Francois-Poncet wouldn't rule out eventually selling all of Navigation Mixte's insurance operations to Allianz, he stressed the potential for the two groups instead to cooperate.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He also told reporters the acquisition would give Paribas fresh diversity, bringing it properties in food and transport where it has been weak.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> Navigation Mixte has investments in a sugar company, a food and canning concern, a bakery and bus and trucking firms, among others.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And Navigation Mixte has a huge hidden attraction.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Payment by Allianz for the insurance interests it has just bought will help swell the French concern's treasury to an estimated 11 billion francs.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> Paribas said it will bid 1,850 francs a share for Navigation Mixte shares that qualify for a full yearly dividend, and 1,800 francs for those created July 1, which are eligible for partial dividends.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> Alternatively, it said it would offer three Paribas shares, themselves eligible for dividends as of next Jan. 1, for one Navigation Mixte share.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> Paribas shares closed down 30 francs at 610 francs, and Navigation Mixte shares were suspended at 1,800 francs pending the outcome of the bid.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> Paribas said it would publish details of its bid once authorities clear it.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> This is one of the first bids under new takeover rules aimed at encouraging open bids instead of gradual accumulation of large stakes.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Some financial sources said privately that Paribas blundered in failing to move sooner for the insurance and industrial group, bidding only after speculation had pushed up the price.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> Mr. Francois-Poncet responded that his group initially intended to take only a minority stake, striking an alliance with current management.
34 <TAB> 35 <TAB> When notoriously independent-minded Navigation Mixte Chairman Marc Fournier rejected Paribas's offer and began buying Paribas shares in retaliation, Mr. Francois-Poncet said, he felt obliged to bid for control.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He told reporters he had information that Mr. Fournier was preparing to buy as much as 20% of Paribas, up from less than 5% currently.
36 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A bid against Paribas couldn't be ruled out.
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> France's second-largest government-owned insurance company, Assurances Generales de France, has been building its own Navigation Mixte stake, currently thought to be between 8% and 10%.
38 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Analysts said they don't think it is contemplating a takeover, however, and its officials couldn't be reached.

1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Channel One, a satellite-delivered daily program supported by advertising, is scheduled to be launched next March.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Whittle said its field staff signed up the 500 schools in 238 school districts after only eight weeks and company executives now expect to reach their start-up goal of 1,000 schools before the end of this year.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> Christopher Whittle, chairman of the Knoxville, Tenn., media company that is 50% owned by Time Warner Inc., said that by December 1990 he expects to have Channel One installed in about 8,000 schools with a potential audience of six million.

6 <TAB> 8 <TAB> He said his sales force is signing up schools at the rate of 25 a day.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In California and New York, state officials have opposed Channel One.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Whittle said private and parochial schools in both states will be canvassed to see if they are interested in getting the programs.

10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Subscribers also get the Classroom Channel, which will feature ad-free educational programming similar to some public-TV shows, and the Educator's Channel, which will offer instructional programming for teachers and school administrators and will be supported by advertising.
11 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Whittle has met some resistance.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Educational Network, as Mr. Whittle has named the three programs, has been offered to 1,290 school districts and Whittle continues to negotiate with 919 districts.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> About 10% of the school districts approached have rejected the network.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Mr. Whittle said that so far, three of the six schools that carried the program in a five-week test last spring have subscribed to the program.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> One of the test schools, Withrow High School in Cincinnati, rejected the project.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> John Bruner, associate director of communications for Cincinnati Public Schools, said Channel One was rejected because students watching the program didn't fare particularly better on a 28-question current events quiz than a control school without the program and school absences were almost unchanged during the period when the program was being aired.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> "The number of correct responses was 45% on the test and school absences didn't change much," said Mr. Bruner. "The pilot program was received well (by teachers and students), but there wasn't reason enough to sign up.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> We even invited the public to stop by and see the program, but there wasn't much interest."
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Advertisers are showing interest.

7 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Executives say Mr. Gorbachev's moves to break up the government's foreign trade monopoly have created uncertainties as well as opportunities.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Changing legislation has opened the field to thousands of inexperienced Soviet players, many who promise more than they can deliver.
9 <TAB> 12 <TAB> And some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles, their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the Soviet parliament and the governments of the nation's republics.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> "You have to go out to all your constituents," says James H. Giffen, who is spearheading the most ambitious attempt by U.S. firms to break into the Soviet market, involving investment of more than $5 billion in some two dozen joint ventures.

12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Growing public fears about the Soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint-venture plans.

28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The goal of most U.S. firms -- joint ventures -- remains elusive.
29 <TAB> 32 <TAB> Because the Soviet ruble isn't convertible into dollars, marks and other Western currencies, companies that hope to set up production facilities here must either export some of the goods to earn hard currency or find Soviet goods they can take in a counter-trade transaction.

0 <TAB> 2 <TAB> CityFed Financial Corp. said it expects to report a loss of at least $125 million to $150 million for the third quarter.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In the year-earlier period, CityFed had net income of $485,000, but no per-share earnings.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> CityFed's president and chief executive officer, John Atherton, said the loss stems from several factors.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> He said nonperforming assets rose to slightly more than $700 million from $516 million between June and September.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Approximately 85% of the total consisted of nonperforming commercial real estate assets.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Accordingly, CityFed estimated that it will provide between $85 million and $110 million for credit losses in the third quarter.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> CityFed added that significant additional loan-loss provisions may be required by federal regulators as part of the current annual examination of City Federal Savings Bank, CityFed's primary subsidiary, based in Somerset, N.J. City Federal operates 105 banking offices in New Jersey and Florida.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Mr. Atherton said CityFed will also mark its portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions divest themselves of such bonds.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> That action, CityFed said, will result in a charge against third-quarter results of approximately $30 million.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> CityFed also said it expects to shed its remaining mortgage loan origination operations outside its principal markets in New Jersey and Florida and, as a result, is taking a charge for discontinued operations.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> All these actions, Mr. Atherton said, will result in a loss of $125 million to $150 million for the third quarter.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He added, however: "Depending on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mortgages servicing and the outcome of the annual examination of City Federal currently in progress with respect to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves, the total loss for the quarter could significantly exceed this range."

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> New orders for durable goods fell back slightly in September after shooting up the month before, reflecting weakening auto demand after a spurt of orders for new 1990 models, the Commerce Department reported.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Orders for military equipment, household appliances, machinery and other goods expected to last at least three years dipped 0.1% last month, to $126.68 billion, after leaping 3.9% in August, the department said.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Most analysts had expected a sharper decline after the steep rise in August.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> Moreover, a recent government report showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing had contributed to perceptions that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a crawl.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> But many economists pointed to a 1.8% September rise in orders outside the volatile transportation category.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That "suggests the manufacturing sector is not falling apart," said Sally Kleinman, an economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. in New York.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> She added, however: "It is not robust by any means."
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total, an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56%, and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases, including airplanes, missiles, ships, tanks and communications equipment.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Orders for military goods usually catapult in September, government officials say, as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably didn't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Without the increase in defense bookings, September orders would have plummeted 3.9%.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Analysts were most unsettled by evidence the backlog of orders at factories is slipping.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 0.4% in September, to $476.14 billion, after declining for the first time in 2 1/2 years in August.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> In July unfilled orders grew 1%.
15 <TAB> 17 <TAB> But analysts noted that excluding transportation-where what they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures-order backlogs have declined for three months in a row.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "It means we're eating into the bread that keeps us going.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That is a little disturbing," Ms. Kleinman said. "It also means if you have a real drop-off in orders, production will likely fall off very quickly because there is less to keep things going."
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> Capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row, posting a 5.6% drop after a 10.3% decline.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Such steep drops in a category seen as a barometer of business investment would customarily be grave news for the economy.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But a Commerce Department analyst said that in both months orders would have risen had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings, a category that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Still, Milton Hudson, senior economic adviser at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. in New York, said: "If you look back a half-year or so the evidence was pretty good of affirmative strength in the capital-goods sector.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Now at least there are question marks about that, and without any question the pace of growth has slowed."

1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Concern about the volatile U.S. stock market had faded in recent sessions, and traders appeared content to let the dollar languish in a narrow range until tomorrow, when the preliminary report on third-quarter U.S. gross national product is released.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But seesaw gyrations in the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday put Wall Street back in the spotlight and inspired market participants to bid the U.S. unit lower.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> UAL's decision to remain an independent company sent share prices tumbling.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> By midmorning, the DJIA had plunged 80 points and foreign-exchange dealers quickly drove the dollar down.

6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Stock prices, meanwhile, posted significant gains in later trading and closed down by only 3.69 points on the day.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Some dealers said that the market's strong reaction to Wall Street reflects a general uneasiness about the dollar.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They added that the DJIA's swift drop proved an easy excuse for the market to drive the U.S. currency in the direction it was already headed.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.8355 marks, down from 1.8470 marks Monday, and at 141.45 yen, down from 141.90 yen late Monday.

13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> He argues that the dollar is now "moving sideways," adding that "the next leg could be the beginning of a longer term bearish phase."
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Analysts peg the dollar's recent weakness to an underlying slowdown in the U.S. economy, highlighted by recent economic data, particularly a surprisingly sharp widening in the August U.S. trade gap.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They also point out that narrowing interest-rate differentials between the U.S. and its major trading partners tend to make the U.S. currency less attractive to foreign investors.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Despite several spurts of dollar trading, it was noted that mark-yen cross trade grabbed much of the market's attention.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Following the dive in U.S. stocks, the mark has strengthened more than its major counterparts.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> Traders attribute the mark's surge to a robust West German economy and higher rate differentials.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But, they add that the mark's strength is in part a reflection of a shift away from U.S. assets by Japanese investors into West German investments.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "The question remains: how much can the West German market absorb?" says one senior dealer.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Some dealers say that Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita's reassurance that Japanese monetary policy won't be changed for the time being has given investors an added excuse to push the yen down even further against the mark.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Manville Corp. said it offered to buy $500 million of its convertible preferred stock from the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust in a move that would improve the trust's liquidity and reduce the potential number of Manville shares outstanding.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Manville said it made the offer within the past several weeks as part of an effort to improve shareholder value.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> It said it would purchase the stock at market price.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Manville and a spokeswoman for the trust said that the two are discussing the proposal but a decision hasn't been made. "We are considering that offer along with all other alternatives," the trust spokeswoman said. "We need to look at how to maximize our cash flow to pay our beneficiaries."
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> The trust, created as part of Manville's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases, owns 7.2 million of the Series A convertible preferred shares, which are each convertible into 10 Manville common shares.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The trust also owns half of Manville's 48 million common shares outstanding.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Based on Manville's closing price yesterday of $9.25 a share, Manville's offer would purchase about 5.4 million of its preferred shares, or about 75% of the trust's preferred stock holding.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> In addition to the stock and 20% of Manville's profits beginning in 1992, the trust is supposed to receive $2.5 billion over its 27-year life.

11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> As part of its offer, Manville said it requested changes in some covenants between it and the trust to allow Manville to "reflect a more typical corporate ownership and financial structure." A Manville spokesman wouldn't elaborate on the proposed changes.

1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> But no matter how much Japan gets under our skin, we'll still have mom and apple pie.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> On second thought, make that just mom.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> A Japanese apple called the Fuji is cropping up in orchards the way Hondas did on U.S. roads.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> By 1995 it will be planted more often than any other apple tree, according to a recent survey of six apple-industry sages by Washington State University horticulturist Robert Norton.
5 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Some fruit visionaries say the Fuji could someday tumble the Red Delicious from the top of America's apple heap.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It certainly won't get there on looks.
7 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Compared to the Red Delicious, the exemplar of apple pulchritude, the Fuji is decidedly more dowdy -- generally smaller, less-perfectly shaped, greenish, with tinges of red.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> To hear most U.S. growers tell it, we'd still be in Paradise if the serpent had proffered one to Eve.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> But how sweet it is.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> It has more sugar "than any apple we've ever tested," says Duane Greene, a University of Massachusetts pomologist, or apple scholar.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It has a long shelf life and "doesn't fool the public," says Grady Auvil, an Orondo, Wash., grower who is planting Fujis and spreading the good word about them. "It doesn't look nice on the outside while getting mealy inside."
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Mr. Auvil, razor sharp at 83, has picked and packed a zillion pecks of apples over the past 65 years.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> He is known as the father of the U.S.-grown Granny Smith, a radically different apple that the conventional wisdom once said would never catch on.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It did, shaking the apple establishment to its roots.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Now, even more radical changes seem afoot as the grand old maverick of American apples plays the role of Hiroshi Appleseed. "The Fuji is going to be No. 1 to replace the Red Delicious," he says.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Delicious hegemony won't end anytime soon.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> New apple trees grow slowly, and the Red Delicious is almost as entrenched as mom.
18 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Its roots are patriotic -- with the first trees appearing in 1872 in an orchard near Peru, Iowa, to be exact.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For more than 50 years, it has been the apple of our eye.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A good Delicious can indeed be delicious.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> More than twice as many Red Delicious apples are grown as the Golden variety, America's No. 2 apple.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> But the apple industry is ripe for change. "Red Delicious has been overplanted, and its prices have dropped below the cost of production," says Washington State's Mr. Norton.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> The scare over Alar, a growth regulator that makes apples redder and crunchier but may be carcinogenic, made consumers shy away from the Delicious, though they were less affected than the McIntosh.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The glut and consequent lower prices, combined with cancer fears, was a very serious blow to growers. "A lot of growers won't be around in a few years," says Mr. Norton, although they have stopped using Alar.
25 <TAB> 27 <TAB> One may be William Broderick, a Sterling, Mass., grower. "This is beautiful stuff," he says, looking ruefully at big boxes of just-picked Red Delicious next to his barn. "But I'm going to lose $50,000 to $60,000 on it.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> I'm going to have to get another job this year just to eat."
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Besides rotten prices, he has been hit recently by hail, a bark-nibbling horde of mice, fungi and bugs.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Some 500 insects and 150 diseases wiggle, chew and romp through growers' nightmares, including maggots, mites, mildew, thrips, black rot and the flat-headed borer.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Even if a grower beats them back, his $2,000 rented bees might buzz off to the neighbors' orchards instead of pollinating his, Mr. Broderick says.
30 <TAB> 33 <TAB> Though growers can't always keep the worm from the apple, they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety by diversifying -- into the recently imported Gala, a sweet New Zealand native; the Esopus Spitzenburg, reportedly Thomas Jefferson's favorite apple; disease-resistant kinds like the Liberty. "I've ripped out a lot of Delicious" and grafted the trees with many different shoots, says Steve Wood, a West Lebanon, N.H., grower, tramping through his 100-acre Poverty Lane Orchard on a crisp autumn day recently. "I've got 70 kinds of apples.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> Here's a Waltana," he exclaims, picking one off a tree.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He bites it, scowls and throws it down. "It's a real dog."
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> Supermarkets are getting into the variety act, too.
34 <TAB> 35 <TAB> They still buy apples mainly for big, red good looks -- that's why so many taste like woodchucks' punching bags.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But freshness counts more than it once did, and stores are expanding shelf space for unconventional, but tastier, and often pricier, apples. "Rather than sell 39-cents-a-pound Delicious, maybe we can sell 79-cents-a-pound Fujis," says Chuck Tryon, perishables director for Super Valu Inc., a Minneapolis supermarket chain and food distributor.
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> The Fuji is a product of meticulous Japanese pomological engineering, which fostered it 50 years ago at a government research orchard.
37 <TAB> 39 <TAB> Japanese researchers have bred dozens of strains of Fujis to hone its color, taste and shelf life.
38 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Now the best of them age as gracefully as Grannies, the industry's gold standard for storability.
39 <TAB> 40 <TAB> In the cornucopia of go-go apples, the Fuji's track record stands out: During the past 15 years, it has gone from almost zilch to some 50% of Japan's market.
40 <TAB> 42 <TAB> "The Japanese apple market is very keyed to high quality," says David Lane, a scientist at a Canadian horticulture research center in Summerland, British Columbia, and so apples are more of a delicacy there than a big food commodity.
41 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that this year Americans will eat about 40% more fresh apples per capita than the Japanese.
42 <TAB> 43 <TAB> The Fuji is still small potatoes in the U.S., sold mainly in fruit boutiques.
43 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But in California, says Craig Ito, a Fuji-apple grower, "There's a Fuji apple cult.
44 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Once somebody eats one, they get hooked."
45 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Auvil, the Washington grower, says that he could sell Fujis to Taiwan buyers at $40 a box if he had them. (Taiwan already is a big importer of Fujis from other places, he adds.) But his first crop won't be picked till next year. "I expect to see the demand exceed supply for Fujis for the next 10 to 15 years," he adds.
46 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Washington Red Delicious, by the way, are wholesaling for less than $10 a box these days.
47 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Auvil sees Fujis, in part, as striking a blow against the perversion of U.S. apples by supermarkets. "When the chain stores took over, there was no longer a connection between grower and consumer.
48 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A guy is sitting up in an office deciding what you're going to eat."
49 <TAB> 50 <TAB> After all, until the 1950s even the Red Delicious was a firm, delectable morsel.
50 <TAB> 51 <TAB> Then, as growers bred them more for looks, and to satisfy supermarket chains' demands of long-term storage, the Red went into decline.
51 <TAB> 56 <TAB> Now, those red applelike things stores sell in summer are fruitbowl lovely, but usually not good eating.
52 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They do deserve respect, however -- they are almost a year old, probably equal to about 106 in human years.
53 <TAB> 54 <TAB> The Fuji, to be sure, has blemishes too.
54 <TAB> 55 <TAB> It ripens later than most apples, and growing it in U.S. areas with chilly autumns may be tricky.
55 <TAB> 57 <TAB> Moreover, the frumpy Fuji must compete with an increasingly dolledup Delicious.
56 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Broderick, the Massachusetts grower, says the "big boss" at a supermarket chain even rejected his Red Delicious recently because they weren't waxed and brushed for extra shine.
57 <TAB> 58 <TAB> And he hadn't used hormones, which many growers employ to elongate their Delicious apples for greater eye appeal.
58 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Still, Mr. Auvil points out, Grannies became popular without big, red looks, so why not Fujis?
59 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He sees a shift in American values -- at least regarding apples -- toward more emphasis on substance and less on glitz. "Taste has finally come to the fore," he says.
60 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Or, for that matter, the core.

0 <TAB> 2 <TAB> If a hostile predator emerges for Saatchi & Saatchi Co., co-founders Charles and Maurice Saatchi will lead a management buy-out attempt, an official close to the company said.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Financing for any takeover attempt may be problematic in the wake of Friday's stock-market sell-off in New York and turmoil in the junk-bond market.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But the beleaguered British advertising and consulting giant, which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace Maurice Saatchi, has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Last week, Saatchi's largest shareholder, Southeastern Asset Management, said it had been approached by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> And Carl Spielvogel, chief executive officer of Saatchi's big Backer Spielvogel Bates advertising unit, said he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the company, but was rebuffed by Charles Saatchi.
5 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Mr. Spielvogel said he wouldn't launch a hostile bid.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> The executive close to Saatchi & Saatchi said that "if a bidder came up with a ludicrously high offer, a crazy offer which Saatchi knew it couldn't beat, it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> But {otherwise} it would undoubtedly come back" with an offer by management.
8 <TAB> 10 <TAB> The executive said any buy-out would be led by the current board, whose chairman is Maurice Saatchi and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be Charles Saatchi.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Spielvogel isn't part of the board, nor are any of the other heads of Saatchi's big U.S.-based ad agencies.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The executive didn't name any price, but securities analysts have said Saatchi would fetch upward of $1.3 billion.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> The executive denied speculation that Saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy-back.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive, Robert Louis-Dreyfus, who joins Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Mr. Louis-Dreyfus, formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm IMS International Inc., has a reputation as a savvy financial manager, and will be charged largely with repairing Saatchi's poor financial state.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Asked about the speculation that Mr. Louis-Dreyfus has been hired to pave the way for a buy-out by the brothers, the executive replied, "That isn't the reason Dreyfus has been brought in.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He was brought in to turn around the company."
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Separately, several Saatchi agency clients said they believe the company's management shakeup will have little affect on them.
17 <TAB> 20 <TAB> "It hasn't had any impact on us, nor do we expect it to," said a spokeswoman for Miller Brewing Co., a major client of Backer Spielvogel.

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's chief oil futures marketplace, is at a critical juncture.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Several longtime observers of the commodities industry think the fortunes of the Merc over the next decade will be determined to a large extent by how well its new natural gas futures contract does and how successful its new president is in raising the level of compliance by floor traders with exchange and Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If the exchange falters in these moves, they say, it might once again fall behind its chief New York competitor, the Commodity Exchange.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> On Friday, the Merc's board announced that it had approved Sabine Pipe Line Co. 's Henry Hub in Erath, La., as the delivery site for its long-awaited natural gas futures contract.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> It also said that it would start trading the contract as soon as the CFTC approved it.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> The CFTC has 90 days to respond to such applications.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Merc first started working on developing this contract in 1984.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Only three weeks earlier, the Merc had turned to one of its own executives, 40-year-old R. Patrick Thompson, to replace Rosemary T. McFadden as president.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Mr. Thompson is believed to have a mandate from the board of directors to help improve the Merc's tarnished reputation as an exchange whose floor traders don't follow the rules very well.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Ms. McFadden had been forced out in July in a bitter power struggle with Z. Lou Guttman, chairman and a longtime floor trader on the exchange.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Guttman told one person familiar with the New York exchanges during the search for a replacement that he was looking for a president who would be "responsive to the needs of the membership and the board."
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Mr. Thompson first came to the exchange in 1981 and has been executive vice president since March 1988.
12 <TAB> 15 <TAB> He previously held posts of senior vice president of compliance and senior vice president and general counsel.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> By contrast, the Comex in July imported a highly regarded outsider, Arnold F. Staloff, as its president.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Staloff, 44, was a senior officer of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and is considered a specialist in new financial products.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Thompson isn't bereft of experience with new products, however.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> For the past two years, he said, he and the exchange's research department have been working on the new natural gas contract, seeking a good delivery site and studying the natural gas market.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> "Our members are eager to begin trading this contract, so we expect no difficulty in attracting locals to the natural gas pit," he said.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The educational effort of teaching companies in the natural gas industry how to use the futures to hedge would have to continue for another a year or two, he added.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Merc's extremely successful contracts in crude oil, gasoline and heating oil have made it the largest futures exchange in New York, and third behind the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
20 <TAB> 30 <TAB> In a recent interview, Mr. Thompson said the biggest problem facing all commodity exchanges was one of image.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Earlier this year, the U.S. attorney indicted 45 floor traders and one clerk at the two big Chicago exchanges.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> Federal authorities in New York started investigating exchanges in May, though no indictments have been handed down there.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> So far they have issued scores of subpoenas, some of which went to members of the New York Merc.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Thompson will have to face some of the consequences of those subpoenas.
25 <TAB> 28 <TAB> In a recent General Accounting Office study, the Merc was found to have been the most lax in enforcing exchange rules.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It levied the smallest number of suspensions of traders and fines of the four largest commodity exchanges studied over the past five years.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It also had both the fewest, and least experienced, investigators per million contracts traded.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> The Merc received considerable criticism in 1987 when it was discovered that its compliance director, Kevin P. Conway, who then was responsible for policing the exchange's busy oil and metal pits, "was engaged in other personal business activities on Exchange time," including out-of-state trips, according to a New York Merc report prepared last year.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Conway is no longer at the exchange.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "We had a management breakdown in 1987 in terms of compliance," Mr. Thompson says. "We recognized the problem and took care of it." He says that even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly, the 1990 business plan calls for having adequate compliance people to ensure that exchange rules are being followed.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> For years the five New York exchanges have been talking about cooperating in various aspects of their business in order to improve the efficiency of their operations.
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> Periodically, there has even been talk of mergers between one or more exchanges.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> So far there is little to show for such efforts.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Thompson believes the case for working together is stronger now than ever. "The cost of competition has become extremely high," he says. "We must find ways to save money for the futures commission merchants who do business on our exchanges." He thinks that progress in cooperation can be made in areas where no vested interests have built up.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> One of those areas is the development of a hand-held electronic device that would permit floor traders to enter trades as they make them.
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> The GAO has recommended the creation of a system to record trade data so that an independent, verifiable audit trail can be established to prevent customer fraud.
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> The Merc is now cooperating with the Comex in developing such a device to provide such an audit trail.
38 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Chicago exchanges also are working on such a device.
39 <TAB> 40 <TAB> Another major electronics problem faces Mr. Thompson -- the creation of a 24-hour trading system that can be used outside normal trading hours.
40 <TAB> 41 <TAB> In January, the New York Merc signed a letter of intent with the Chicago Merc as a preliminary step to joining their electronic system called Globex.
41 <TAB> 42 <TAB> But in May, the Chicago Merc said it was looking into creating a common system with the Chicago Board of Trade, and it suspended negotiations with the New York Merc.
42 <TAB> 43 <TAB> Mr. Thompson says his exchange isn't waiting for the results of the Chicago exchanges' cooperation.
43 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It recently began a pilot program to test an electronic trading system called ATS/2, the automated trading system created by the International Commodities Clearing House.
44 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:
45 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Copper
46 <TAB> 47 <TAB> Michael Frawley, metals trader for PaineWebber Inc. in New York, said there is good technical support between $1.10 and $1.12 a pound for December copper, which ended Friday at $1.1580 a pound, up 1.6 cents.
47 <TAB> 48 <TAB> He views the $1.10 to $1.12 range as a buying opportunity and considers the market oversold.
48 <TAB> 49 <TAB> "I think the market could pop up to the $1.22 to $1.25 level without too much difficulty," he said.
49 <TAB> 53 <TAB> But he said it won't climb further and he expects it to remain in a trading range between $1.10 and $1.25.
50 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He noted that the equity markets will set the tone for the industrial metals this week and traders should keep an eye on Wall Street.
51 <TAB> -1 <TAB> William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc. in New York, said for a rally to occur, there must be demand from the Far East.
52 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He added that talk of strike settlements at producing mines has been fully discounted.
53 <TAB> 54 <TAB> However, to resume the bull trend, according to Mr. O'Neill, copper would have to close over $1.19.
54 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He said there are two reports this week that might affect prices: the purchasing managers report on Wednesday and the unemployment report on Friday.
55 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Precious Metals
56 <TAB> 57 <TAB> Friday's strong price gains confirmed a turnaround in the precious metals markets, according to PaineWebber's Mr. Frawley. "Most traders will be looking to buy {on} pullbacks," he said.
57 <TAB> 59 <TAB> He thought the moves in the metals last week were most influenced by the uncertainty in the equity and other financial markets.
58 <TAB> -1 <TAB> According to Mr. Frawley, floor traders say there is good support for December gold in the $374 to $375 per ounce area, around $5.20 an ounce for December silver and in the $485 to $490 an ounce range for January platinum.
59 <TAB> 60 <TAB> William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc. in New York, said the price action for all of last week is the best he has seen on a weekly basis in more than a year.
60 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He said last week's activity in gold could portend a move to $390 an ounce for the December contract.
61 <TAB> 62 <TAB> He also said traders should keep an eye on the stock market, because "if the stock market rallies, that could spell trouble for the precious metals."
62 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He said traders should be on the lookout for how metals producers react to this rally. "I expect to see some selling, but will they kill this one as they have every rally in the recent past" by selling and locking in prices for their production?
63 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He noted that for the first time in months there was some light investor interest in the metals.
64 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Grains And Soybeans
65 <TAB> 69 <TAB> Prices this week will likely be dominated by reports on the progress of the corn and soybean harvest as well as by speculation about more purchases of U.S. crops by the Soviet Union.
66 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In recent weeks, warm and dry weather has sped the Midwest harvest and that is permitting farmers to rebuild the stockpiles that were cut by the 1988 drought.
67 <TAB> 68 <TAB> If the weather allowed farmers to work in their fields over the weekend, many Midwest grain elevators will probably sell futures contracts today at the Chicago Board of Trade in order to hedge their weekend purchases from farmers.
68 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That selling of futures contracts by elevators is what helps keep downward pressure on crop prices during the harvest.
69 <TAB> 70 <TAB> Traders will also watch for whether the Soviet Union continues its traditional fall buying of U.S. grain.
70 <TAB> -1 <TAB> So far this month, the Soviets have bought about 7.2 million metric tons of U.S. corn.
71 <TAB> 72 <TAB> There may be some activity in soybean prices this week as investors try to get rid of the contract for November delivery.
72 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Investors usually don't want to take physical delivery of a contract, preferring instead to profit from its price swings and then end any obligation to take delivery or make delivery as it nears expiration.

1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That's the word expected to be on the lips of the more than 3,000 developers, pension-fund advisers and real estate financiers slated to attend a four-day conference, beginning here today, sponsored by the Urban Land Institute.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The ULI is a non-profit research and education group based in Washington, D.C., with 14,000 members nationwide.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> With the market overbuilt, builders are finding limited opportunities and increased risks.
4 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Developers and money managers are looking for bargains among the thousands of financially troubled properties around the country.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Real estate professionals now often bill themselves as "turnaround experts" and "workout specialists."
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Conference attendees are expected to be buzzing about the workings of the recently formed Resolution Trust Corp., a federal agency charged with disposing of an estimated $200 billion of real estate dumped in government hands by insolvent savings and loans.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Developers are also eyeing the real estate portfolios of major corporations.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Some plan to pursue foreign development ventures, mostly in Europe.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> And other developers may shift from commercial to residential development in the U.S.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "There aren't as many economically viable alternatives for real estate developers in this country as 10 years ago," says Charles Shaw, a Chicago-based real estate developer. "So developers are saying they will look into distressed properties.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They'll go into someone else's pasture as long as it's greener than the one they're in now."
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Developers are also forming more joint ventures with pension funds and insurance companies that can finance big projects.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> The builders are more willing to give up some equity and rely on management and consulting fees to stay afloat in the soft market. "Developers are teaming up with institutions often acting as project managers," says Smedes York, ULI president and president of York Properties Inc., of Raleigh, N.C. "They are growing more pragmatic about their role."
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Real estate firms are also using their alliances with financial institutions to amass acquisition funds. "Why should you beat your brains out fighting the environmentalists, the neighborhood groups, dealing with traffic mitigation, sewers and fighting city hall, then try to convince a lender to lend you money in an overbuilt market when you can get pension fund money, buy a portfolio, sell off pieces off it and play your own game?" says Jack Rodman, managing partner of the Los Angeles office of Kenneth Leventhal Inc. a national accounting firm.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But experts say that when it comes to distressed properties, finding diamonds in the rough isn't easy.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The level of interest in the RTC's properties has been greater than expected, and has come from larger companies than initially anticipated, says Stan Ross, Leventhal's co-managing partner.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> And to succeed in the turnaround business, he says, developers may have to put in a lot of money and time.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Finding pension funds and other sources willing to invest is a high priority.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Quips David Shulman, director of real estate research for Salomon Brothers Inc.: "A theme of the Urban Land conference will be `take a pension fund manager to lunch. '"

1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Today, Here Tomorrow
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> TWO COMPANIES plan to market a new chip with ceramic circuits that store data even when the power is off.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Today's most widely used data-storing chips have "volatile" memories -- their data disappear if they aren't fed a steady diet of electricity, so they need external power supplies.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> National Semiconductor Corp. and a start-up named Ramtron Corp. plan to start shipping so-called ferroelectric memories, which can remember data for at least 10 years without any current flowing to them.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> The chips use materials, such as lead zirconate titanate, to form microscopic switches that retain their data without electricity.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Developers caution that broad applications are several years away because the technology isn't fully refined.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> But Ramtron of Colorado Springs, Colo., plans to start shipping commercial quantities of simple ferroelectric chips in December.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The company expects the chips eventually to be used in devices that mimic a whole range of computer memory equipment, including floppy-disk and hard-disk drives.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> National Semiconductor is getting ferroelectric technology from Krysalis Corp. in Albuquerque, N.M. National says it agreed to acquire Krysalis's assets and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips, including a 4-kilobit memory, next year.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Once production hurdles are overcome, the chips could take over a significant part of the market.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> In addition to not needing an outside power source, they are potentially cheaper to make because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Military buyers have shown interest, National says, because ferroelectric chips resist atomic radiation.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And while today's non-volatile chips -- such as electronically erasable programmable read-only memory chips -- can't be used in a computer's central memory because they "learn" data slowly, ferroelectric chips accept data at very high speeds.

17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Witnesses often must travel long distances to give face-to-face depositions before lawyers and court reporters.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That means huge travel bills.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And telephone or videotape depositions just don't match physical encounters.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That could change, thanks to lower long-distance rates and cheaper electronics.
21 <TAB> 23 <TAB> Video Telecom Corp., which markets videoconferencing systems, is working with court reporters to wire a nationwide network to allow depositions by live television.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The company installed a prototype system that connects Dallas with Miami over digital phone lines.

26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Japanese Reverse Tack
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> On Patent Protection
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> JAPAN'S MISUSE of U.S. patents has been a sore point for American chip makers.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> Now at least one Japanese company is turning the courtroom tables.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Until now, most Japanese charges have been responses to suits against them.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> But last year Hitachi Ltd. surprised Japan's electronics industry when it accused Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. of using Hitachi technology to make dynamic random-access memory chips. (A settlement was reached but wasn't made public.) And Hitachi went on the offensive against the U.S.'s Motorola Inc. earlier this month with a suit charging that Motorola's new MC88200 chip infringes on a Hitachi patent.
32 <TAB> 34 <TAB> Another recent Hitachi suit accuses Motorola of reverse engineering a Hitachi technology -- a turnabout from a nation of champion reverse engineers.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The moves illustrate the more aggressive attitude toward patent protection that patent experts say Japan is starting to take.
34 <TAB> 35 <TAB> Hitachi made the reverse-engineering charges in an amendment to a counterclaim filed in a federal district court in Texas after Motorola sued Hitachi for patent violation.
35 <TAB> 36 <TAB> Hitachi charges Motorola "has engaged in fraudulent and inequitable conduct in the procurement of certain Motorola patents" used in Motorola's MC68030 microprocessor chip.
36 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Translation: Motorola appears to have taken a Hitachi technology that is patented in the U.S., Hitachi says, and "tried to make it look like a new technology."

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> The oil industry's middling profits could persist through the rest of the year.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago, largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The gasoline picture may improve this quarter, but chemicals are likely to remain weak, industry executives and analysts say, reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> The industry is "seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals," Glenn Cox, president of Phillips Petroleum Co., said in an interview. "That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings" for the industry in general, he added.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> He didn't forecast Phillips's results.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> But securities analysts say Phillips will be among the companies hard-hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> So, too, many analysts predict, will Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp. and Amoco Corp.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Typical is what happened to the price of ethylene, a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> It has plunged 13% since July to around 26 cents a pound.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A year ago ethylene sold for 33 cents, peaking at about 34 cents last December.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A big reason for the chemical price retreat is overexpansion.
11 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Beginning in mid-1987, prices began accelerating as a growing U.S. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Companies added capacity furiously.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Now, greatly increased supplies are on the market, while the dollar is stronger, and domestic economic growth is slower.
14 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker. "Refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year," said William Randol, a securities analyst at First Boston Corp.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August that didn't materialize.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In addition, crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier, further pressuring profitability.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> Refiners say margins picked up in September, and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter, though still not to the level of 1988's fourth quarter.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> During the 1988 second half, many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies' earnings this year.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Prices -- averaging roughly $2 a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier -- have stayed well above most companies' expectations.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> Demand has been much stronger than anticipated, and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter. "We could see higher oil prices this year," said Bryan Jacoboski, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That will translate into sharply higher production profits, particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $13 a barrel in the fourth quarter.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> While oil prices have been better than expected, natural gas prices have been worse.
25 <TAB> 29 <TAB> In the third quarter, they averaged about 5% less than they were in 1988.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> The main reason remains weather.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> Last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to burn more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This summer, on the other hand, had milder weather than usual.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> "We've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices," said Mr. Cox, Phillips's president. "The lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected."
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> Going into the fourth quarter, natural gas prices are anywhere from 8% to 17% lower than a year earlier.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For instance, natural gas currently produced along the Gulf Coast is selling on the spot market for around $1.47 a thousand cubic feet, down 13% from $1.69 a thousand cubic feet a year ago.

1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> While Wall Street's tough times and lower U.S. interest rates continue to undermine the dollar, weakness in the pound and the yen is expected to offset those factors. "By default," the dollar probably will be able to hold up pretty well in coming days, says Francoise Soares-Kemp, a foreign-exchange adviser at Credit Suisse. "We're close to the bottom" of the near-term ranges, she contends.

5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> The dollar began Friday on a firm note, gaining against all major currencies in Tokyo dealings and early European trading despite reports that the Bank of Japan was seen unloading dollars around 142.70 yen.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> The rise came as traders continued to dump the pound after the sudden resignation Thursday of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> But once the pound steadied with help from purchases by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the dollar was dragged down, traders say, by the stock-market slump that left the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a loss of 17.01 points.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> With the stock market wobbly and dollar buyers discouraged by signs of U.S. economic weakness and the recent decline in U.S. interest rates that has diminished the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments, traders say the dollar is still in a precarious position. "They'll be looking at levels to sell the dollar," says James Scalfaro, a foreign-exchange marketing representative at Bank of Montreal.
9 <TAB> 11 <TAB> While some analysts say the dollar eventually could test support at 1.75 marks and 135 yen, Mr. Scalfaro and others don't see the currency decisively sliding under support at 1.80 marks and 140 yen soon.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Predictions for limited dollar losses are based largely on the pound's weak state after Mr. Lawson's resignation and the yen's inability to strengthen substantially when there are dollar retreats.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> With the pound and the yen lagging behind other major currencies, "you don't have a confirmation" that a sharp dollar downturn is in the works, says Mike Malpede, senior currency analyst at Refco Inc. in Chicago.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> As far as the pound goes, some traders say a slide toward support at $1.5500 may be a favorable development for the dollar this week.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> While the pound has attempted to stabilize, currency analysts say it is in critical condition.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Sterling plunged about four cents Thursday and hit the week's low of $1.5765 when Mr. Lawson resigned from his six-year post because of a policy squabble with other cabinet members.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> He was succeeded by John Major, who Friday expressed a desire for a firm pound and supported the relatively high British interest rates that he said "are working exactly as intended" in reducing inflation.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> But the market remains uneasy about Mr. Major's policy strategy and the prospects for the pound, currency analysts contend.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Although the Bank of England's tight monetary policy has fueled worries that Britain's slowing economy is headed for a recession, it is widely believed that Mr. Lawson's willingness to prop up the pound with interest-rate increases helped stem pound selling in recent weeks.
18 <TAB> 22 <TAB> If there are any signs that Mr. Major will be less inclined to use interest-rate boosts to rescue the pound from another plunge, that currency is expected to fall sharply.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> "It's fair to say there are more risks for the pound under Major than there were under Lawson," says Malcolm Roberts, a director of international bond market research at Salomon Brothers in London.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> "There's very little upside to sterling," Mr. Roberts says, but he adds that near-term losses may be small because the selling wave that followed Mr. Major's appointment apparently has run its course.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But some other analysts have a stormier forecast for the pound, particularly because Britain's inflation is hovering at a relatively lofty annual rate of about 7.6% and the nation is burdened with a struggling government and large current account and trade deficits.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> The pound likely will fall in coming days and may trade as low as 2.60 marks within the next year, says Nigel Rendell, an international economist at James Capel & Co. in London.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The pound was at 2.8896 marks late Friday, off sharply from 2.9511 in New York trading a week earlier.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> If the pound falls closer to 2.80 marks, the Bank of England may raise Britain's base lending rate by one percentage point to 16%, says Mr. Rendell.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But such an increase, he says, could be viewed by the market as "too little too late." The Bank of England indicated its desire to leave its monetary policy unchanged Friday by declining to raise the official 15% discount-borrowing rate that it charges discount houses, analysts say.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> Pound concerns aside, the lack of strong buying interest in the yen is another boon for the dollar, many traders say.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> The dollar has a "natural base of support" around 140 yen because the Japanese currency hasn't been purchased heavily in recent weeks, says Ms. Soares-Kemp of Credit Suisse.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The yen's softness, she says, apparently stems from Japanese investors' interest in buying dollars against the yen to purchase U.S. bond issues and persistent worries about this year's upheaval in the Japanese government.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> On New York's Commodity Exchange Friday, gold for current delivery jumped $5.80, to $378.30 an ounce, the highest settlement since July 12.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Insurers may see claims resulting from the San Francisco earthquake totaling nearly $1 billion -- far less than the claims they face from Hurricane Hugo -- but the recent spate of catastrophes should jolt property insurance rates in coming months.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> The property claims service division of the American Insurance Services Group estimated insured losses from the earthquake at $960 million.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> This estimate doesn't include claims under workers' compensation, life, health disability and liability insurance and damage to infrastructure such as bridges, highways and public buildings.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> The estimated earthquake losses are low compared with the $4 billion in claims that insurers face from Hurricane Hugo, which ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That's because only about 30% of California homes and businesses had earthquake insurance to cover the losses.
5 <TAB> 7 <TAB> However, insurance brokers and executives say that the combination of the Bay area earthquake, Hugo and last week's explosion at the Phillips Petroleum Co. 's refinery in Pasadena, Texas, will cause property insurance and reinsurance rates to jump.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Other insurance rates such as casualty insurance, which would cover liability claims, aren't likely to firm right away, says Alice Cornish, an industry analyst with Northington Research in Avon, Conn.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> She believes the impact of losses from these catastrophes isn't likely to halt the growth of the industry's surplus capital next year.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Property reinsurance rates are likely to climb first, analysts and brokers believe. "The reinsurance market has been bloodied by disasters" in the U.S. as well as in Great Britain and Europe, says Thomas Rosencrants, director of research at Interstate/Johnson Lane Inc. in Atlanta.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Insurers typically retain a small percentage of the risks they underwrite and pass on the rest of the losses.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Insurers buy this insurance protection for themselves by giving up a portion of the premiums they collect on a policy to another firm -- a reinsurance company, which, in turn, accepts a portion of any losses resulting from this policy.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Insurers, such as Cigna Corp., Transamerica Corp, and Aetna Life & Casualty Co., buy reinsurance from other U.S.-based companies and Lloyd's of London for one catastrophe at a time.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> After Hugo hit, many insurers exhausted their reinsurance coverage and had to tap reinsurers to replace that coverage in case there were any other major disasters before the end of the year.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> After the earthquake two weeks ago, brokers say companies scrambled to replace reinsurance coverages again and Lloyd's syndicates turned to the London market excess lines for protection of their own.
14 <TAB> 17 <TAB> James Snedeker, senior vice president of Gill & Roeser Inc., a New York-based reinsurance broker, says insurers who took big losses this fall and had purchased little reinsurance in recent years will be asked to pay some pretty hefty rates if they want to buy reinsurance for 1990.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> However, companies with few catastrophe losses this year and already big buyers of reinsurance are likely to see their rates remain flat, or perhaps even decline slightly.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Many companies will be negotiating their 1990 reinsurance contracts in the next few weeks.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "It's a seller's market," said Mr. Snedeker of the reinsurance market right now.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> But some large insurers, such as State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., don't purchase reinsurance, but fund their own program.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> A few years ago, State Farm, the nation's largest home insurer, stopped buying reinsurance because no one carrier could provide all the coverage that it needed and the company found it cheaper to self-reinsure.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The $472 million of losses State Farm expects from Hugo and an additional $300 million from the earthquake are less than 5% of State Farm's $16.7 billion total net worth.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Since few insurers have announced what amount of losses they expect to see from the earthquake, it's impossible to get a clear picture of the quake's impact on fourth-quarter earnings, said Herbert Goodfriend at Prudential-Bache Securities Corp.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Transamerica expects an after-tax charge of less than $3 million against fourth-quarter net; Hartford Insurance Group, a unit of ITT Corp., expects a $15 million or 10 cents after-tax charge; and Fireman's Fund Corp. expects a charge of no more than $50 million before taxes and after using its reinsurance.

0 <TAB> 4 <TAB> When the Trinity Repertory Theater named Anne Bogart its artistic director last spring, the nation's theatrical cognoscenti arched a collective eyebrow.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Ms. Bogart, an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages that tear into such sacred texts as Rodgers and Hammerstein's "South Pacific," is decidedly downtown.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Trinity Rep meanwhile is one of the nation's oldest and most respected regional theaters, still hosting an annual "A Christmas Carol."
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> How would this bastion of traditional values fare in Ms. Bogart's iconoclastic hands?
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> She held her fire with her first production at the Trinity earlier this season.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It was a predictable revival of her prize-winning off-Broadway anthology of Bertolt Brecht's theoretical writings, called "No Plays, No Poetry."
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Now, with the opening of Maxim Gorky's bourgeois-bashing "Summerfolk," Ms. Bogart has laid her cards on the table.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Hers is a hand that will test the mettle of her audiences.
8 <TAB> 13 <TAB> For Ms. Bogart, who initially studied and directed in Germany (and cites such European directors as Peter Stein, Giorgio Strehler and Ariane Mnouchkine as influences) tends to stage her productions with a Brechtian rigor -- whether the text demands it or not.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> And Gorky, considered the father of Soviet socialist realism, did not write plays that easily lend themselves to deliberately antirealistic distancing techniques.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Gorky was a loyal if occasionally ambivalent proletarian writer committed to enlightening the masses with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of Chekhovian humanism.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> And "Summerfolk," penned in 1904 as a kind of sequel to Chekhov's "Cherry Orchard," is a lawn party of Russian yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Along the way there also are lots of romantic dalliances.
13 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Wisely Ms. Bogart has kept Gorky's time and place intact.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Despite the absence of samovars (and a tendency to turn the furniture upside down), the production is rich in Russian ennui voiced by languorous folk sporting beige linen and rumpled cotton, with boaters and fishing poles aplenty.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But beyond this decorative nod to tradition, Ms. Bogart and company head off in a stylistic direction that all but transforms Gorky's naturalistic drama into something akin to, well, farce.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> The director's attempt to force some Brechtian distance between her actors and their characters frequently backfires with performances that are unduly mannered.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Not only do the actors stand outside their characters and make it clear they are at odds with them, but they often literally stand on their heads.
18 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Like Peter Sellars, Ms. Bogart manipulates her actors as if they were rag dolls, sprawling them on staircases, dangling them off tables, even hanging them from precipices while having them perform some gymnastic feats of derring-do.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> There are moments in this "Summerfolk" when the characters populating the vast multilevel country house (which looks like a parody of Frank Lloyd Wright and is designed by Victoria Petrovich) spout philosophic bon mots with the self-conscious rat-a-tat-tat pacing of "Laugh In." "Talk hurts from where it spurts," one of them says.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> The clash of ideologies survives this treatment, but the nuance and richness of Gorky's individual characters have vanished in the scuffle.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> As for the humor that Gorky's text provides, when repainted in such broad strokes (particularly by the lesser members of the ensemble) it looks and sounds forced.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> Ms. Bogart does better with music than with words when she wants, as she so often does want, to express herself through Gorky's helpless play.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> Here she has the aid of her longtime associate Jeff Helpern, whom she appointed Trinity's first-ever musical director and whom she equipped with a spanking new $60,000 sound system and recording studio.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For Gorky, Mr. Helpern provided an aural collage of Debussy and Rachmaninoff, which is less a score than a separate character with a distinct point of view.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Like Brecht, and indeed Ezra Pound, Ms. Bogart has said that her intent in such manipulative staging of the classics is simply an attempt to "make it new." Indeed, during a recent post-production audience discussion, the director explained that her fondest artistic wish was to find a way to play "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" so that the song's "original beauty comes through," surmounting the cliche.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The danger that Ms. Bogart seems to be courting here is one of obfuscation rather than rejuvenation, a vision so at odds with the playwright's that the two points of view nullify, rather than illuminate, each other.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Ms. Bogart's cast is part and parcel of the problem.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Ed Shea and Barbara Orson never find a real reason for their love affair as the foolish, idealistic young Vass and the tirelessly humanitarian doctor Maria Lvovna.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Cynthia Strickland as the long-suffering Varvara is a tiresome whiner, not the inspirational counterrevolutionary Gorky intended.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Better to look in the corners for performances that inspire or amuse.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Janice Duclos, in addition to possessing one of the evening's more impressive vocal instruments, brings an unsuspected comedic touch to her role of Olga, everybody's favorite mom.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Marni Rice plays the maid with so much edge as to steal her two scenes.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But it is the Trinity Rep newcomer, Jonathan Fried (Zamislov, the paralegal) who is the actor to watch, whether he is hamming it up while conducting the chamber musicians or seducing his neighbor's wife (Becca Lish) by licking her bosom.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Ms. de Vries writes frequently about theater.

0 <TAB> 2 <TAB> In an age of specialization, the federal judiciary is one of the last bastions of the generalist.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A judge must jump from murder to antitrust cases, from arson to securities fraud, without missing a beat.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But even on the federal bench, specialization is creeping in, and it has become a subject of sharp controversy on the newest federal appeals court.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was created in 1982 to serve, among other things, as the court of last resort for most patent disputes.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Previously, patent cases moved through the court system to one of the 12 circuit appeals courts.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> There, judges who saw few such cases and had no experience in the field grappled with some of the most technical and complex disputes imaginable.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> A new specialty court was sought by patent experts, who believed that the generalists had botched too many important, multimillion-dollar cases.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Some patent lawyers had hoped that such a specialty court would be filled with experts in the field.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> But the Reagan administration thought otherwise, and so may the Bush administration.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Since 1984, the president has filled four vacancies in the Federal Circuit court with non-patent lawyers.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Now only three of the 12 judges -- Pauline Newman, Chief Judge Howard T. Markey, 68, and Giles Rich, 85 -- have patent-law backgrounds.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The latter two and Judge Daniel M. Friedman, 73, are approaching senior status or retirement.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Three seats currently are vacant and three others are likely to be filled within a few years, so patent lawyers and research-based industries are making a new push for specialists to be added to the court.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Several organizations, including the Industrial Biotechnical Association and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, have asked the White House and Justice Department to name candidates with both patent and scientific backgrounds.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> The associations would like the court to include between three and six judges with specialized training.
15 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Some of the associations have recommended Dr. Alan D. Lourie, 54, a former patent agent with a doctorate in organic chemistry who now is associate general counsel with SmithKline Beckman Corp. in Philadelphia.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Dr. Lourie says the Justice Department interviewed him last July.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Their effort has received a lukewarm response from the Justice Department. "We do not feel that seats are reserved (for patent lawyers)," says Justice spokesman David Runkel, who declines to say how soon a candidate will be named. "But we will take it into consideration."
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Justice Department's view is shared by other lawyers and at least one member of the court, Judge H. Robert Mayer, a former civil litigator who served at the claims court trial level before he was appointed to the Federal Circuit two years ago. "I believe that any good lawyer should be able to figure out and understand patent law," Judge Mayer says, adding that "it's the responsibility of highly paid lawyers (who argue before the court) to make us understand (complex patent litigation)."
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Yet some lawyers point to Eli Lilly & Co. vs.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Medtronic, Inc., the patent infringement case the Supreme Court this month agreed to review, as an example of poor legal reasoning by judges who lack patent litigation experience. (Judge Mayer was not on the three-member panel.)
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> In the Lilly case, the appeals court broadly construed a federal statute to grant Medtronic, a medical device manufacturer, an exemption to infringe a patent under certain circumstances.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> If the Supreme Court holds in Medtronic's favor, the decision will have billion-dollar consequences for the manufacturers of medical devices, color and food additives and all other non-drug products that required Food & Drug Administration approval.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> Lisa Raines, a lawyer and director of government relations for the Industrial Biotechnical Association, contends that a judge well-versed in patent law and the concerns of research-based industries would have ruled otherwise.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> And Judge Newman, a former patent lawyer, wrote in her dissent when the court denied a motion for a rehearing of the case by the full court, "The panel's judicial legislation has affected an important high-technological industry, without regard to the consequences for research and innovation or the public interest."
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Says Ms. Raines, "(The judgment) confirms our concern that the absence of patent lawyers on the court could prove troublesome."

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Santa Fe Pacific Corp. is preparing a plan to sell a 20% stake in its large real estate unit to a California public employee pension fund for $400 million, after which it would spin off the realty operation to shareholders.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> The plan places an indicated value on the real estate operation, Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corp., of $2 billion.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Santa Fe Pacific directors are expected to review the plan at a meeting today, according to people familiar with the transaction.
3 <TAB> 7 <TAB> If approved, the sale is expected to close by year's end, with the spinoff occurring by the end of 1992.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Santa Fe Pacific closed at $20.625, down 25 cents.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Santa Fe Pacific Realty is a major California land and building owner whose prime properties include 1,850 undeveloped acres in the San Francisco Bay area, and several office sites.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A spokesman said the properties survived without significant damage in last week's Northern California earthquake.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> As a result of the partial sale and spinoff, the $56 billion California Public Employees Retirement System would obtain two seats on the board of the real estate operation, according to officials of the fund, who described the plan.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A spokesman for Chicago-based Santa Fe Pacific confirmed that negotiations were being held with the fund.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Also holding two seats each on the board, they said, would be Olympia & York Developments Ltd., controlled by the Reichmann family of Canada, and Itel Corp., controlled by Chicago businessman Sam Zell.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> The Reichmanns and Mr. Zell, the largest holders of Santa Fe Pacific stock, have been looking for ways to raise the value of their investments, including possible spinoffs.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Itel bought a 17% stake in Sante Fe Pacific last year and Olympia & York later purchased about a 20% stake; they would have interests in the new realty company in line with their holdings in Sante Fe Pacific.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The sale and spinoff of the real estate unit is the first phase of what could lead to the breakup of Santa Fe Pacific into free-standing companies for its railroad and energy operations, as well as real estate.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> The debt-laden parent has been under pressure from large shareholders to boost the company's share price.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> At the same time it has been caught in an earnings squeeze.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> The California pension fund's planned investment in the real estate unit is unusual.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Pension funds rarely own as much as a 20% stake in what is expected to be a publicly traded company.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> In addition, pension funds are rarely given seats on company boards and most often try to avoid them because of legal concerns.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But fund officials said the Santa Fe Pacific Realty investment provides an opportunity to buy a stake in a large real estate portfolio heavily weighted with California properties.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It also marks a "major commitment to {real estate} development, which we haven't been involved with before," said Dale Hanson, the fund's executive director.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Under the proposed plan, the fund would also lend Santa Fe Pacific Realty $75 million in the form of a note that would be convertible into additional shares of the realty company after the second year at the then-prevailing market price.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> The note would accrue interest at the rate of 13.5% a year, which would be payable to the fund after five years, according to Stephen E. Roulac, a real estate consultant working for the fund.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The purpose of the note is to provide added capital for the spun-off company in a form that will save it spending cash on immediate interest payments, Mr. Roulac said.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The spun-off concern "clearly will be one of the dominant real estate development companies with a prime portfolio," he said.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> For the last year, Santa Fe Pacific has redirected its real estate operations toward longer-term development of its properties, hurting profits that the parent had generated in the past from periodic sales from its portfolio.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Real estate operating income for the first nine months fell to $71.9 million from $143 million a year earlier, the company said.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> In a statement late yesterday, Santa Fe Pacific's chairman, Robert D. Krebs, said that Santa Fe Pacific Realty would repay more than $500 million in debt owed to the parent before the planned spinoff.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> That would help reduce Santa Fe Pacific's remaining debt to about $600 million from a high of $3.7 billion in early 1988.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It wasn't clear where Santa Fe Pacific expected to obtain the payment of more than $500 million, which would be well above the $400 million that California pension fund officials say they plan to provide.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The realty unit might take on new debt or obtain additional investors, among other possibilities.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Santa Fe Pacific spokesman declined to comment on that aspect, saying the deal was still under negotiation.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> Santa Fe Pacific Realty owns 2.8 million acres of property, including 219 buildings with more than 11 million square feet of space.
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> It also holds nearly 40,000 acres of raw land with development potential, but under a previously announced strategy, the company has targeted building on 5,400 acres in California, Arizona and the Chicago area.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Among those are the 1,850 acres in the San Francisco Bay area, including 208 acres in the Mission Bay area.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The California pension fund, which has $16 billion already invested in real estate and mortgages, could be a valuable funding source for that development, although it isn't obliged to make further investments.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The fund is the nation's largest public employee fund, and it has a growing cash flow now topping $3 billion a year.
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> Fund officials negotiated the final structure of the proposed deal with Santa Fe Pacific, but they were approached with the idea by real estate brokers JMB Realty Corp. of Chicago.
37 <TAB> -1 <TAB> JMB officials are expected to be hired to represent the pension fund on the Santa Fe Pacific Realty board, Mr. Roulac said, to insulate the fund from potential liability problems.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> The bond market, which sometimes thrives on bad news, cheered yesterday's stock market sell-off and perceptions that the economy is growing weaker.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Early in the day, bonds rose modestly on economists' forecasts that this week's slate of economic data will portray an economy headed for trouble.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Such news is good for bonds because economic weakness sometimes causes the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy and stave off a recession.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For example, today the Department of Commerce is scheduled to release the September durable goods report.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> The consensus forecast of 14 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report is for a 1.2% drop in September orders.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That would follow a 3.9% advance in August.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Bonds received a bigger boost later in the day when stock prices moved broadly lower.

13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> In the Treasury market, analysts expect bond prices to trade in narrow ranges this week as the market takes in positive and negative news.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "On the negative side, the market will be affected by constant supply in all sectors of the market," said William M. Brachfeld, economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. "On the other hand, we have economic news that is {expected to be} relatively positive for the bond market.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> We will go back and forth with a tilt toward slightly lower yields," he said.

19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Analysts have mixed views about the two-year note auction.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> While some say the auction should proceed smoothly, others contend that yesterday's sale of $2.58 billion of asset-backed securities by Ford Motor Credit Corp. may have siphoned some potential institutional buyers from the government's note sale.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> The division of auto maker Ford Motor Co. made its debut in the asset-backed securities market with the second-largest issue in the market's four-year history.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> The company offered securities backed by automobile loans through an underwriting group headed by First Boston Corp.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> The issue yields 8.90% and carries a guarantee covering 9% of the deal from the company.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> First Boston sweetened the terms from the original yield estimate in an apparent effort to place the huge offering.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The issue was offered at a yield nearly one percentage point above the yield on two-year Treasurys.

62 <TAB> 63 <TAB> The refunding issue, which had been in the wings for two months, was one of the chief offerings overhanging the market and limiting price appreciation.
63 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But alleviating that overhang failed to stimulate much activity in the secondary market, where prices were off 1/8 to up 3/8 point.
64 <TAB> -1 <TAB> An official with lead underwriter First Boston said orders for the San Antonio bonds were "on the slow side." He attributed that to the issue's aggressive pricing and large size, as well as the general lethargy in the municipal marketplace.
65 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In addition, he noted, the issue would normally be the type purchased by property and casualty insurers, but recent disasters, such as Hurricane Hugo and the Northern California earthquake, have stretched insurers' resources and damped their demand for bonds.
66 <TAB> 67 <TAB> A $137.6 million Maryland Stadium Authority sports facilities lease revenue bond issue appeared to be off to a good start.
67 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The issue was oversubscribed and "doing very well," according to an official with lead underwriter Morgan Stanley.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> A new drug to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs has been successfully used on more than 100 patients at the University of Pittsburgh, according to researchers.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> The drug, which is still in the experimental phase, hasn't been approved yet by the Food and Drug Admistration, and its long-term effects are unknown.
2 <TAB> 4 <TAB> But researchers say the drug, called FK-506, could revolutionize the transplantation field by reducing harmful side effects and by lowering rejection rates.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Rejection has been the major obstacle in the approximately 30,000 organ transplants performed world-wide each year.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Researchers began using the drug in February on patients who had received kidney, liver, heart and pancreas transplants.
5 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Only two of 111 transplants have been rejected.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The drug, discovered in 1984, is metabolized from soil fungus found in Japan.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> The Pittsburgh patients are the first humans to be given the drug, which is made by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> "We're shocked by it, because it's worked so fast," said Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, director of the University of Pittsburgh Transplantation Program, at a news conference here yesterday. "We consider it a life-saving drug, like one for AIDS," said Dr. John Fung, an immunologist at the University of Pittsburgh.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Researchers say they believe FK-506 is 100 times more effective than the traditional anti-rejection drug, cyclosporine, made by Swiss pharmaceutical giant Sandoz Ltd.
10 <TAB> 13 <TAB> They are also encouraged by the relatively mild side effects of FK-506, compared with cyclosporine, which can cause renal failure, morbidity, nausea and other problems. "The side effects {of cyclosporine} have made the penalty for its success rather high," Dr. Starzl said.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Dr. Fung said that FK-506 would not be available in the market for at least a year, and that the FDA approval process usually takes three years to five years.
12 <TAB> 14 <TAB> There are no firm plans to expand the experimental program beyond the University of Pittsburgh, whose hospital performs the most transplants in the world.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Researchers couldn't estimate the cost of the drug when it reaches the market, but they said FK-506 will enable patients to cut hospital stays by 50% and reduce the number of blood tests used to monitor the dosage of cyclosporine and other drugs among transplant recipients.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Dr. Starzl said the research has been largely financed by the National Institute of Health and by university funds, and that Fujisawa didn't give the hospital any grants.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> He said that the research team had no financial stake in the drug.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "We've known for six months the effect of this drug, and our advice to our people has been not to buy the company's stock," Dr. Starzl said, adding that profiting from FK-506 wouldn't be ethical.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Probably the most clear-cut Soviet violation, for example, is the Krasnoyarsk radar. -- "Arms Control Reality," Nov. 20, 1984, the first of some 20 Journal editorials saying that Krasnoyarsk violated the ABM treaty.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> -- "Whether the installation is for early warning or space track, it clearly is not deployed," the lawmakers said. "Thus we judge it to be not a violation of the ABM treaty at this time." The delegation included a reporter from the New York Times, aides to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Rep. Les AuCoin, and Natural Resources Defense Council staff members. -- The Washington Post, Sept. 9, 1987.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> -- The U.S.S.R. has taken unprecedented unilateral measures of openness, by giving American representatives a possibility to inspect the building site of the Krasnoyarsk radar as well as radar vans in the areas of Gomel and Moscow, so as to see for themselves that there are no violations of the ABM treaty of 1972 on the part of the Soviet Union. -- Letter from Eduard Shevardnadze to U.N. Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar, reported in Tass, June 10, 1988.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> -- The construction of this station equal in size to the Egyptian pyramids constituted, I say it directly, a clear violation of ABM. -- Eduard Shevardnadze, Oct. 23, 1989.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> We're happy, we guess, to receive confirmation of the Krasnoyarsk violation from the Soviets, five years after we started writing about it.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Perhaps even the American apologists will now accede.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Without question, something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the Politburo.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> As it bids for new agreements, new loans and indeed admission to the civilized world, the Soviet government has recognized it has a credibility problem.
8 <TAB> 10 <TAB> So after 70 years, it is confessing the obvious, hoping to be believed about other things.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It's not enough.
10 <TAB> 26 <TAB> If the Soviets want to be believed, they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Our own test of "glasnost's" authenticity would be a Soviet decision to open itself to a complete international examination of one of the most troubling mysteries in U.S.-Soviet relations -- the reported 1979 anthrax outbreak at a Soviet military facility in Sverdlovsk.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> The U.S. government has never waivered in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons facility there, and hence a violation of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> The Pentagon's recently issued "Soviet Military Power," though in general adopting a softer line, repeated the Sverdlovsk assessment.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> It also was detailed in Congressional testimony this past February: An explosion at the Microbiology and Virology Institute in Sverdlovsk released anthrax germs that caused a significant number of deaths.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Since Mr. Shevardnadze did not address this topic before the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet Union's official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted meat.
16 <TAB> 18 <TAB> We doubt this claim just as we doubted Mr. Shevardnadze's assurance last year that Krasnoyarsk didn't violate the ABM treaty.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And just as we did not believe the tendentious claims of the Congressmen and arms-control advocates who visited Krasnoyarsk, we are in no way persuaded by the assent to the tainted-meat theory by a U.S. team of scientists who met with Soviet counterparts in Washington last year.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> The Soviets' explanation is that the anthrax came from one lot of animal feed made from the bones of cattle that grazed on soil that was naturally infected with anthrax spores.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Harvard's Matthew Meselson -- who we read has sold something called the "scientific community" on the notion that "yellow rain" attacks on the Laotian Hmong were in fact the result of fecal showers by giant bees -- found the Soviet anthrax scenario "completely plausible."
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> We don't believe it.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And we certainly do not believe that Mr. Gorbachev or any of his emissaries yet deserve to have the West take their word for it.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> Sverdlovsk is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms-control process itself.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> The U.S. government's Sverdlovsk complaint, as with Krasnoyarsk, is no mere political posturing.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> Biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate, and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the U.S. government.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But the stated U.S. position is detailed and specific, and the prospect of biological warfare is profoundly chilling.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Soviets should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to acknowledge that Sverdlovsk violated the 1972 agreement or, alternatively, that would give U.S. specialists reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Until that happens, glasnost cannot begin to deserve the kind of credibility Mr. Shevardnadze was bidding for with his confessions on Monday.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Exxon Corp. filed suit against the state of Alaska, charging state officials interfered with the oil company's initial efforts to treat last spring's giant oil spill.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> The action is a counterclaim to a suit filed by Alaska in August against Exxon and six other oil companies.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> The state's suit alleges that Exxon's response to the spill failed to prevent contamination of hundreds of miles of shoreline along Prince William Sound.
3 <TAB> 6 <TAB> That suit and Exxon's countersuit were filed in a state court in Anchorage.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Neither suit lists specific dollar claims, largely because damage assessment hasn't yet been completed.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Legal strategists say that damage claims against the oil giant and others could well exceed $1 billion.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Litigation, if not settled out of court, could drag on for years.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Exxon said in its suit that it will seek reimbursement from the state for that part of the cleanup costs and damage claims it says resulted from the state's conduct.
8 <TAB> 12 <TAB> The oil company claims that Alaskan officials prevented Exxon from spraying dispersant onto the almost 11 million gallons of oil dumped when one of its tankers ran into an underwater reef.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Craig Tillery, an Alaska assistant attorney general, said in an interview last night that Exxon's accusations "are not new.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Exxon has made them before, at which point the state demonstrated they were untrue.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The state will vigorously defend against any counterclaim."
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Since the spill last March, Exxon and the state have been wrangling over whether spraying dispersant on the oil in the first hours after the spill, when the weather was clear and calm, would have helped limit the environmental damage.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Exxon claims that use of dispersants, which break an oil slick into microscopic droplets, was a crucial part of its immediate-response plan and that state officials banned their use during the two days of fair weather following the spill.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> The oil company claims that it had permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to the spill to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of the U.S. Coast Guard.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> The state's opposition to the use of dispersants, Exxon says, caused the Coast Guard "to delay granting permission."
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Alaskan and Coast Guard officials say Exxon's charges aren't relevant because tests conducted during the first two days following the spill showed that the dispersant wasn't working anyway.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Use of dispersants was approved when a test on the third day showed some positive results, officials said.

3 <TAB> 5 <TAB> As it happens, the Nasdaq composite did continue to fall for two days after the initial plunge.

15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They note that when an unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap in August was reported earlier this month, hopes for a sustained narrowing of the trade deficit were dashed and sentiment gripped the market that the U.S. economy was losing its momentum.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A 190-point plunge in U.S. stock shares compounded the view, they say.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "Everyone is extremely convinced the economy is slowing," says one senior New York dealer. "If we're not headed for a recession, we're certainly headed for a major slowdown."
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> While the market expects little reaction from news of U.S. durable goods orders, scheduled for release today, participants note that the figures will probably serve to reinforce this bearish sentiment.

2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged, though unsuccessfully, ASKO's Dutch lawyers noted.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense, ASKO will then ask the court to overturn such a vote-diluting maneuver recently deployed by Koninklijke Ahold NV. ASKO says the Dutch-based international food retailer hadn't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of ASKO and other shareholders.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Speaking through its Dutch lawyers, ASKO also disclosed it holds a 15% stake in Ahold.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It was previously thought ASKO held a 13.6% stake that was accumulated since July.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> HomeFed Corp. said third-quarter net income slid 14% to $23.9 million, or $1.10 per fully diluted share, from $27.9 million, or $1.21 a fully diluted share, because of increased bad assets and unexpected trouble in unloading foreclosed property.
1 <TAB> 3 <TAB> The decline surprised analysts and jolted HomeFed's stock, which lost 8.6% of its value, closing at $38.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, down $3.625.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> HomeFed had been one of the handful of large West Coast thrifts that in recent quarters had counteracted interest-rate problems dogging the industry by keeping a lid on problem assets and lending heavily into the furious California housing market.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Analysts had been projecting fully diluted earnings in the third quarter in the range of about $1.30 a share.
4 <TAB> 11 <TAB> However, HomeFed's loan originations and purchases plunged 26% in the quarter, to $1.4 billion from $1.9 billion a year earlier.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Meanwhile, non-performing assets rose to $593 million from $518.7 million.

10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It said sales of such properties were slower than anticipated in the third quarter, but it expects sales to pick up in the rest of the year.
11 <TAB> 13 <TAB> HomeFed said the slide in loan originations was more a matter of design than a sign of cooling in the California market.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Any such downturn in California would be grim news for West Coast thrifts, particularly the less healthy ones, which have performed poorly even with a torrid market.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But HomeFed said it purposely curbed loan originations in the quarter because of uncertainty over the new capital requirements and regulations that will emerge from negotiations over implementing the government's massive thrift bailout bill.

0 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Factory owners are buying new machinery at a good rate this fall, machine tool makers say, but sluggish sales of new cars and trucks raise questions about fourth-quarter demand from the important automotive industry.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> September orders for machine tools rebounded from the summer doldrums, but remained 7.7% below year-earlier levels, according to figures from NMTBA -- the Association for Manufacturing Technology.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Domestic machine tool plants received $303 million of orders last month, up 33% from August's $227.1 million, but still below the $328.2 million of September 1988, NMTBA said.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Machine tools are complex machines ranging from lathes to metal-forming presses that are used to shape most metal parts.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> "Overall demand still is very respectable," says Christopher C. Cole, group vice president at Cincinnati Milacron Inc., the nation's largest machine tool producer. "The outlook is positive for the intermediate to long term."
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> September orders for all U.S. producers, in fact, were slightly above the monthly average for 1988, a good year for the industry.
6 <TAB> 8 <TAB> "Aerospace orders are very good," Mr. Cole says. "And export business is still good.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> While some automotive programs have been delayed, they haven't been canceled."
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "September was one of the biggest order months in our history," says James R. Roberts, vice president, world-wide sales and marketing, for Giddings & Lewis Inc., Fond du Lac, Wis.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> At a recent meeting of manufacturing executives, "everybody I talked with was very positive," he says.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Most say they plan to spend more on factory equipment in 1990 than in 1989.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> But sales of North American-made 1990-model cars are running at an annual rate of only six million, down from 7.1 million a year earlier.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And truck sales also are off more than 20%.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Auto makers, who began deferring some equipment purchases last spring, can be expected to remain cautious about spending if their sales don't pick up, machine tool builders say.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Machine tool executives are hopeful, however, that recent developments in Eastern Europe will expand markets for U.S.-made machine tools in that region.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> There is demand for state-of-the-art machine tools in the Soviet Union and in other Eastern European countries as those nations strive to improve the efficiency of their ailing factories as well as the quality of their goods.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> However, there's a continuing dispute between machine tool makers and the Defense Department over whether sophisticated U.S. machine tools would increase the Soviet Union's military might. "The Commerce Department says go, and the Defense Department says stop," complains one machine tool producer.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If that controversy continues, U.S. machine tool makers say, West German and other foreign producers are likely to grab most of the sales in Eastern Europe.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> September orders for machining centers, lathes, milling machines, grinders, boring mills and other machines that shape metal by cutting totaled $192.9 million, down 28% from $266.5 million a year earlier, but a 23% increase from August's $156.3 million, NMTBA said.
19 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Orders last month for metal-forming presses and other machinery to form metal with pressure surged to $110.1 million, a 78% rise from $61.7 million a year earlier and a 55% gain from $70.9 million in August.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Today's presses are large and costly machines, and a few orders can produce a high total for one month that doesn't necessarily indicate a trend.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Machine tool shipments last month were $281.2 million, a 24% rise from a year earlier and a 25% increase from August.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> Shipments have run well ahead of 1988 all year, as machine tool builders produce against relatively good backlogs.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> U.S. producers had a $2.15 billion backlog of unfilled orders at the end of September.

0 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. said it will delay a proposed two-step, 830 million Canadian-dollar (US$705.6 million) expansion of its system because Canada's output of crude oil is shrinking.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Interprovincial, Canada's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S., said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991, 8% lower than a previous estimate.
2 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989's first half, about 1% below the 1988 level.
3 <TAB> 5 <TAB> "The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping," and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically, as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas, said Ronald Watkins, vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial's parent, Interhome Energy Inc. Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial's system is down about 2% since January and is expected to fall further, making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side," he said.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Many of Canada's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil, and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30% from a year ago, and the number of completed oil wells is "down more than that, due to the increasing focus on gas exploration," said Robert Feick, manager of crude oil with Calgary's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada, an industry group.
7 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature, conventional fields in western Canada.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Interprovincial transports about 75% of all crude produced in western Canada, and almost 60% of Interprovincial's total volume consists of light crude.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial's system, whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region, including Chicago, Buffalo, Toronto and Montreal.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Canada's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day, or about 9.1% of net U.S. crude imports, said John Lichtblau, president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude, behind Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Mexico.
12 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Mr. Lichtblau said Canada's declining crude output, combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude, will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas, particularly the Middle East. "It's very much a growing concern.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But when something is inevitable, you learn to live with it," he said.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Lichtblau stressed that the delay of Interprovincial's proposed expansion won't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore crude, however, since Canadian imports are limited in any case by Canada's falling output.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Under terms of its proposed two-step expansion, which would have required regulatory approval, Interprovincial intended to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system, beginning with a modest expansion by 1991.

0 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Ripples from the strike by 55,000 Machinists union members against Boeing Co. reached air carriers Friday as America West Airlines announced it will postpone its new service out of Houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from the Seattle jet maker.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Peter Otradovec, vice president for planning at the Phoenix, Ariz., carrier, said in an interview that the work stoppage at Boeing, now entering its 13th day, "has caused some turmoil in our scheduling" and that more than 500 passengers who were booked to fly out of Houston on America West would now be put on other airlines.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Mr. Otradovec said Boeing told America West that the 757 it was supposed to get this Thursday wouldn't be delivered until Nov. 7 -- the day after the airline had been planning to initiate service at Houston with four daily flights, including three nonstops to Phoenix and one nonstop to Las Vegas.
3 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Now, those routes aren't expected to begin until Jan.
4 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Boeing is also supposed to send to America West another 757 twin-engine aircraft as well as a 737 by year's end.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Those, too, are almost certain to arrive late.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> At this point, no other America West flights -- including its new service at San Antonio, Texas; Newark, N.J.; and Palmdale, Calif. -- have been affected by the delays in Boeing deliveries.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Nevertheless, the company's reaction underscores the domino effect that a huge manufacturer such as Boeing can have on other parts of the economy.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It also is sure to help the machinists put added pressure on the company.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "I just don't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged walkout," Tom Baker, president of Machinists' District 751, said in an interview yesterday. "I don't think their customers would like it very much."
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> America West, though, is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be. "I figure that American and United probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets, they might not miss one at all," Mr. Otradovec said.
11 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Indeed, a random check Friday didn't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Southwest Airlines has a Boeing 737-300 set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time. "It's so close to completion, Boeing's told us there won't be a problem," said a Southwest spokesman.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> A spokesman for AMR Corp. said Boeing has assured American Airlines it will deliver a 757 on time later this month.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> American is preparing to take delivery of another 757 in early December and 20 more next year and isn't anticipating any changes in that timetable.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> In Seattle, a Boeing spokesman explained that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Meanwhile, supervisors and non-striking employees have been trying to finish some 40 aircraft -- mostly 747 and 767 jumbo jets at the company's Everett, Wash., plant -- that were all but completed before the walkout.
17 <TAB> 31 <TAB> As of Friday, four had been delivered and a fifth plane, a 747-400, was supposed to be flown out over the weekend to Air China.
18 <TAB> 21 <TAB> No date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table. "We want to make sure they know what they want before they come back," said Doug Hammond, the federal mediator who has been in contact with both sides since the strike began.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The investment community, for one, has been anticipating a speedy resolution.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Though Boeing's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market Friday, it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders. "The market has taken two views: that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very rosy for Boeing in the long term," said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Cyrus J.

1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Mr. Hastings's case was particularly nettlesome because it marked the first time a federal official was impeached and removed from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted him.
2 <TAB> 4 <TAB> In 1983, Mr. Hastings was found not guilty of accepting a $150,000 bribe in a case before him, the central charge on which the Senate convicted him.
3 <TAB> 14 <TAB> He was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial.

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Maidenform Inc. loves to be intimate with its customers, but not with the rest of the public.
1 <TAB> 11 <TAB> The 67-year-old maker of brassieres, panties, and lingerie enjoys one of the best-known brand images, but its financial profile is closely guarded by members of the founding family. "There are very few companies that can boast of such a close-knit group," says Robert A. Brawer, 52 years old, recently named president, succeeding Beatrice Coleman, his mother-in-law, who remains chairman. "We are a vanishing breed," he muses.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Mrs. Coleman, 73, who declined to be interviewed, is the Maidenform strategist.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Sales have tripled during her 21-year tenure to about $200 million in 1988.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Maidenform says it is very profitable but declines to provide specifics.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The company sells image.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Its current ad campaign, on which Maidenform has spent more than $15 million since fall 1987, doesn't even show its underwear products, but rather men like Christopher Reeve, star of the "Superman" movies, talking about their lingerie turn-ons.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> The Maidenform name "is part of American pop culture," says Joan Sinopoli, account supervisor of the campaign by Levine, Huntley, Schmidt & Beaver, a New York ad firm.
8 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Maidenform generated such memorable campaigns as "I dreamed I . . . in my Maidenform bra," and "The Maidenform woman.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> You never know where she'll turn up."
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "Capitalizing on the brand is key," says Mr. Brawer, whose immediate plans include further international expansion and getting better control of distribution outside the U.S.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "The intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly {Maidenform} is a force to be reckoned with," says David S. Leibowitz, a special situations analyst at American Securities Corp. in New York.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Although working women are "forced to wear the uniform of the day, to retain their femininity they are buying better quality, more upscale intimate apparel," he said.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Although Mr. Brawer's appointment as president was long expected, the move on Sept. 25 precipitated the resignation of Alan Lesk as senior vice president of sales and merchandising.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Three days later, Mr. Lesk was named president and chief executive officer of Olga Co., a competing intimate apparel division of Warnaco Inc. Warnaco also owns Warners, another major intimate apparel maker.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Mr. Lesk couldn't be reached to comment.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But Maidenform officials say that after spending 24 years at Maidenform, Mr. Lesk, 48, made it clear he wanted the top job. "If you want the presidency of the company, this isn't the firm to work for," says James Mogan, 45, who was named senior vice president of sales, assuming some of the responsibilities of Mr. Lesk.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The company downplayed the loss of Mr. Lesk and split his merchandising responsibilities among a committee of four people. "My style is less informal," Mr. Brawer says.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> Top officers insist Maidenform's greatest strength is its family ownership. "You can't go anywhere in this company and find an organizational chart," one delights. "It is fun competing as a private company," Mr. Brawer says. "You can think long range."
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Other major players in intimate apparel apparently feel the same way.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Warnaco was taken private by Spectrum Group in 1986 for about $487 million.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> And last year, Playtex Holdings Inc. went private for about $680 million.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It was then split into Playtex Apparel Inc., the intimate apparel division, and Playtex Family Products Corp., which makes tampons, hair-care items and other products.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Publicly traded VF Corp., which owns Vanity Fair, and Sara Lee Corp., which owns Bali Co., are also strong forces in intimate apparel.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> Buy-out offers for Maidenform aren't infrequent, says Executive Vice President David C. Masket, but they aren't taken very seriously.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> When he gets calls, "I don't even have to consult" with Mrs. Coleman, Mr. Masket says.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The company could command a good price in the market. "Over the past three and a half years, apparel companies, many of whom have strong brand names, have been bought at about 60% of sales," says Deborah Bronston, Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. apparel analyst.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> Mr. Brawer, along with Mrs. Coleman and her daughter, Elizabeth, an attorney who is vice chairman, are the family members involved in the operations of Maidenform, which employs about 5,000.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> Mr. Brawer's wife, Catherine, and Robert Stroup, Elizabeth's husband, round out the five-member board.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Each has an equal vote at the monthly meetings. "We are all very amiable," Mr. Brawer says.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> Executives say Mrs. Coleman is very involved in the day-to-day operations, especially product development.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In the late 1960s she designed a lightweight stretch bra that boosted sales.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Her father, William Rosenthal, designed the then-dress making company's first bra in the 1920s, which he said gave women a "maiden form" compared with the "boyish form" they got from the "flat bandages" used for support at the time.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> While Mr. Rosenthal introduced new undergarment designs, his wife, Ida, concentrated on sales and other financial matters.
34 <TAB> 35 <TAB> The name Maidenform was coined by a third business partner, Enid Bissett.
35 <TAB> 36 <TAB> The company has 14 plants and distribution facilities in the U.S., Puerto Rico, other parts of the Caribbean and Ireland.
36 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Maidenform products are mainly sold at department stores, but the company has quietly opened a retail store of its own in Omaha, Neb., and has 24 factory outlets, with plans to add more.
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> Before joining Maidenform in 1972, Mr. Brawer, who holds a doctoral degree in English from the University of Chicago, taught at the University of Wisconsin.
38 <TAB> 39 <TAB> As a senior vice president, he has headed the company's designer lingerie division, Oscar de la Renta, since its inception in 1988.
39 <TAB> 40 <TAB> To maintain exclusivity of that designer line, it isn't labeled with the Maidenform name.
40 <TAB> -1 <TAB> While the company has always been family-run, Mr. Brawer isn't the first person to marry into the family and subsequently head Maidenform.

1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Thomas Jefferson sold Congress on the idea of the decimal system for currency, thus saving Americans the headaches of pounds, shillings and pence.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> But he struck out with the decimal system of metric weights and measures the French had invented.

11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Today, though the public is barely aware, much of U.S. industry, particularly companies manufacturing or selling overseas, have made metrics routine.
12 <TAB> 17 <TAB> General Motors, for example, uses metric terms for its automobile bodies and power trains. (In auto advertising, however, items such as wheelbases are still described in inches.) Farm-machine makers such as Caterpillar and Deere work in the metric system.

0 <TAB> 2 <TAB> The real estate slump that's pushing down the price of New York office space and housing is also affecting the city's retail real estate market.
1 <TAB> 3 <TAB> In Manhattan, once-desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill.
2 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy, turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> "There is an unbelievable amount of space available," says Faith Consolo, senior vice president at Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> There are about 2,000 stores for rent, up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500. "This further confuses retailers," she says. "They wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down?
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Is this the wrong time to open a store?
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Who is going to be in the space next door?"
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> In addition, Ms. Consolo says, tenants usually can negotiate to pay rents that are about one-quarter lower than landlords' initial asking price.
8 <TAB> 10 <TAB> A handful of hot retail locations, such as the 57th Street and Madison and Fifth Avenue areas, have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And, in some neighborhoods, rents have merely hit a plateau.
10 <TAB> 18 <TAB> But on average, Manhattan retail rents have dropped 10% to 15% in the past six months alone, experts say.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months, after Manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> The same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing. "As businesses contract or depart, the number of employees who might use retail services shrinks," says Edward A. Friedman, senior vice president of Helmsley Spear Inc.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> He says financial problems plaguing electronics, fur and furniture companies -- key categories in the local retail economy -- have further deflated the market.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Hardest hit are what he calls "secondary" sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> In these locations, Mr. Friedman says, "Retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined." Weakness in the restaurant industry, which is leaving retail space vacant, exacerbates the problem for landlords.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It is also no comfort to landlords and small New York retailers when the future of larger department stores, which anchor retail neighborhoods, are in doubt.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Hooker Corp., parent of Bonwit Teller and B. Altman's, is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and Bloomingdale's is for sale by its owner, Campeau Corp.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> But, despite the recent softening, for many of these retailers there's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s, when their leases were signed.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Certainly, the recent drop in prices doesn't mean Manhattan comes cheap.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> New York retail rents still run well above the going rate in other U.S. cities.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> Madison and Fifth Avenues and East 57th Street can command rents of up to $500 a square foot, and $250 is not uncommon.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> The thriving 34th Street area offers rents of about $100 a square foot, as do up-and-coming locations along lower Fifth Avenue.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> By contrast, rentals in the best retail locations in Boston, San Francisco and Chicago rarely top $100 a square foot.

10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> It is a quick fix for a complex problem.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Far from promoting a commonality of interests among black, white, Hispanic and other minority voters, drawing the district lines according to race suggests that race is the voter's and the candidate's most important trait.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Such a policy implies that only a black politician can speak for a black person, and that only a white politician can govern on behalf of a white one.
13 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Examples of the divisive effects of racial gerrymandering can be seen in two cities -- New York and Birmingham, Ala.
14 <TAB> 18 <TAB> When they reapportion their districts after the 1990 census, every other municipality and state in the country will face this issue.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> New York City: Racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in New York City since 1970, when Congress first amended the Voting Rights Act to expand its reach beyond the Southern states.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In 1972, the Justice Department required that the electoral map in the borough of Brooklyn be redrawn to concentrate black and Hispanic votes, despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of Hasidic Jews into two different districts.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This year, a commission appointed by the mayor to revise New York's system of government completed a new charter, expanding the City Council to 51 from 35 members.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Sometime in 1991, as soon as the 1990 census becomes available, a redistricting panel will redraw the City Council district lines.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Charter Revision Commission has made it clear that in response to the expectations of the Justice Department and the commission's own commitment to enhancing minority political leadership, the new district lines will be drawn to maximize the number of solidly minority districts.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Blacks and Hispanics currently make up 38% of the city's population and hold only 25% of the seats on the council.
21 <TAB> 28 <TAB> Several of the city's black leaders, including Democratic mayoral nominee David Dinkins, have spoken out for racial gerrymandering to accord blacks and Hispanics "the fullest opportunity for representation."
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> In this connection, it is important to note that several members of New York's sitting City Council represent heterogeneous districts that bring together sizable black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white populations -- Carolyn Maloney's 8th district in northern Manhattan and the south Bronx and Susan Alter's 25th district in Brooklyn, for example.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> To win their seats on the council, these political leaders have had to listen to all the voices in their district and devise public policies that would benefit all.

25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> Birmingham, Ala.: The unusual situation in Birmingham vividly illustrates the divisive consequences of carving out safe districts for racial minorities.
26 <TAB> 29 <TAB> In Birmingham, which is 57% black, whites are the minority.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Insisting that they are protected by the Voting Rights Act, a group of whites brought a federal suit in 1987 to demand that the city abandon at-large voting for the nine member City Council and create nine electoral districts, including four safe white districts.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The white group argued that whites were not fully and fairly represented, because in city-wide elections only black candidates or white candidates who catered to "black interests" could win.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> No federal court has ruled that the Voting Rights Act protects a white minority, but in June the Justice Department approved a districting plan for Birmingham that carves out three white-majority districts and six black-majority districts.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Richard Arrington, Birmingham's black mayor, lamented the consequences. "In the past, people who had to run for office had to moderate their views because they couldn't afford to offend blacks or whites," he said. "Now you go to districts, you're likely to get candidates whose views are more extreme, white and black, on racial issues." Two hundred years ago, critics of the new United States Constitution warned that the electoral districts for Congress were too large and encompassed too many different economic interests.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A small farmer and a seaport merchant could not be represented by the same spokesman, they said.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But James Madison refuted that argument in one of the most celebrated political treatises ever written, No. 10 of the Federalist Papers.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> Madison explained that a representative's duty was to speak not for the narrow interests of one group but instead for the common good.
34 <TAB> 35 <TAB> Large, heterogeneous election districts would encourage good government, said Madison, because a representative would be compelled to serve the interests of all his constituents and be servile to none.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Madison's noble and unifying vision of the representative still can guide us.
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> As long as we believe that all Americans, of every race and ethnic background, have common interests and can live together cooperatively, our political map should reflect our belief.
37 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Racial gerrymandering -- creating separate black and white districts -- says that we have discarded that belief in our ability to live together and govern ourselves as one people.

1 <TAB> 3 <TAB> House leaders had hoped to follow the Senate's lead by getting an agreement from House committee chairmen under which they would drop items that wouldn't reduce the fiscal 1990 budget deficit from the House-passed bill before the negotiations with the Senate began.

"Many members feel there are important features of the House bill that should be enacted," Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said. "If there is any support for reducing the bill, it is conditioned on their desire to see them passed in another form."

0 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Congress sent to President Bush an $8.5 billion military construction bill that cuts spending for new installations by 16% while revamping the Pentagon budget to move more than $450 million from foreign bases to home-state projects.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The fiscal 1990 measure builds on a pattern set earlier this year by House and Senate defense authorizing committees, and -- at a time of retrenchment for the military and concern about the U.S.'s standing in the world economy -- overseas spending is most vulnerable.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Total Pentagon requests for installations in West Germany, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the Philippines, for example, are cut by almost two-thirds, while lawmakers added to the military budget for construction in all but a dozen states at home.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> The result is that instead of the Pentagon's proposed split of 60-40 between domestic and foreign bases, the reduced funding is distributed by a ratio of approximately 70-30.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The extra margin for bases in the U.S. enhances the power of the appropriations committees; meanwhile, lawmakers used their positions to garner as much as six times what the Pentagon had requested for their individual states.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten (D., Miss.) helped secure $49.7 million for his state, or more than double the Pentagon's budget.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> West Virginia, home of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, would receive $21.5 million -- four times the military's request.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Tennessee and North Carolina, home states of the two Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate military construction subcommittees, receive $243.2 million, or 25% above the Pentagon's request.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Though spending for Iowa and Oregon was far less, their increases above Pentagon requests -- 640% and 430%, respectively -- were much greater because of the influence of Republicans at critical junctures.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> The swift passage of the bill, which cleared the Senate and House on simple voice votes last week, contrasts with the problems still facing a more cumbersome $66.8 billion measure funding housing, environmental, space and veterans programs.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> By an 84-6 margin, the Senate approved the bulk of the spending Friday, but the bill was then sent back to the House to resolve the question of how to address budget limits on credit allocations for the Federal Housing Administration.
11 <TAB> 17 <TAB> The House Democratic leadership could seek to waive these restrictions, but the underlying bill is already under attack for excesses elsewhere.
12 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Appropriations committees have used an assortment of devices to disguise as much as $1 billion in spending, and as critics have awakened to these devices, the bill can seem like a wounded caribou trying to make it past ice and wolves to reach safer winter grazing.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Much of the excess spending will be pushed into fiscal 1991, and in some cases is temporarily parked in slow-spending accounts in anticipation of being transferred to faster-spending areas after the budget scorekeeping is completed.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> For example, a House-Senate conference ostensibly increased the National Aeronautics and Space Administration budget for construction of facilities to nearly $592 million, or more than $200 million above what either chamber had previously approved.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Part of the increase would provide $90 million toward ensuring construction of a costly solid rocket-motor facility in Mr. Whitten's Mississippi.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But as much as $177 million, or nearly 30% of the account, is marked for potential transfers to research, management and flight accounts that are spent out at a faster clip.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The bill's managers face criticism, too, for the unusual number of conditions openly imposed on where funds will be spent.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> Conservatives, embarrassed by Republican influence-peddling scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, have used the issue in an effort to shift blame onto a Democratic-controlled Congress.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> HUD Secretary Jack Kemp backed an unsuccessful effort to strike such language last week, but received little support from the White House budget office, which wants to protect space-station funding in the bill and has tended to turn its eyes from pork-barrel amendments.

6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Federal's employees work long hours and seem to thrive on the stress of racing the clock.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Like Mr. Brown, they sometimes go to surprising lengths to meet that overarching corporate goal: delivering the goods on time.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They are a tribute to Federal's management which, since the company's founding 16 years ago, has had its way with its work force -- an unusual feat in the contentious transportation industry.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That may soon change.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> This month, Federal's 2,048 pilots, including some 961 acquired along with Tiger International Inc. in February, will decide whether to elect the powerful Air Line Pilots Association as their bargaining agent.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> The election, which would bring the first major union to Federal's U.S. operations, has pitted new hires against devoted veterans such as Mr. Brown.
12 <TAB> 14 <TAB> It has also rattled Federal's strongly anti-union management, which is already contending with melding far-flung operations and with falling profits.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "A union, sooner or later, has to have an adversary, and it has to have a victory," Frederick W. Smith, Federal's chairman and chief executive, says with disdain. "In our formula, we don't have any losers except the competition."
14 <TAB> 18 <TAB> What managers really fear is that the pro-union movement could spread beyond the pilots.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Under federal transportation law, a government mediator is attempting to reconcile the melding of Tiger's job classifications into Federal's.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Depending on the outcome, the merged company may face union elections this fall among airplane mechanics, ramp workers, stock clerks and flight dispatchers.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> These groups constitute up to 10% of its work force.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> "Unions would have a profound effect on the whole culture of the company," says Bernard La Londe, a professor at Ohio State University at Columbus and a Federal consultant.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That culture, carefully crafted by Mr. Smith, leaves little, if any, room for unions.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Since founding the company, the charismatic Vietnam vet, who is still only 46 years old, has fostered an ethos of combat.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Flights are "missions." Mr. Smith's managers have, at times, been called "Ho Chi Minh's Guerrillas." The Bravo Zulu award, the Navy accolade for a "job well done," is bestowed on Federal's workers who surpass the call of duty.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Competitors are known as the "enemy."
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> To reinforce employees' dedication, Mr. Smith pays well.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He also lets workers vent steam through an elaborate grievance procedure and, as a perk, fly free in empty cockpit seats.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He gives pep talks in periodic "family briefings" beamed internationally on "FXTV," the company's own television network.
26 <TAB> 37 <TAB> And, with many of his 70,000 workers, Mr. Smith's damn-the-torpedoes attitude has caught on.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> James Cleveland, a courier who earned a Bravo Zulu for figuring out how to get a major customer's 1,100-parcel-a-week load to its doorstep by 8 a.m., considers himself far more than a courier. "We don't just hand the customer the package.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That's just the beginning," he says. "In essence, we run the show."
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> David Sanders, a longtime pilot, bristles at the mere suggestion that a union might tamper with his flight schedule. "This is America," he says. "Nobody has the right to tell me how much I can work."
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Such attitudes have given Federal flexibility, not only to rapidly implement new technology but to keep its work force extraordinarily lean.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> The company deliberately understaffs, stretching employees' schedules to the limit.
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> But though couriers work as many as 60 hours a week during the autumn rush, they leave early during slack times while still being assured of a minimum paycheck.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Pilots, as well, routinely fly overtime to ensure that none are furloughed during seasonal lows.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The operational freedom has also given Federal a leg up on archrival United Parcel Service Inc., the nation's largest employer of United Brotherhood of Teamsters members.
35 <TAB> 36 <TAB> UPS won't discuss its labor practices, but, according to Mr. Cleveland, a former UPS employee, and others, union work rules prohibit UPS drivers from doing more than carrying packages between customers and their vans.
36 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Because UPS drivers aren't permitted to load their own vehicles at the depot, say these couriers, packages often get buried in the load and are delivered late.
37 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Labor problems are the last thing Mr. Smith needs right now.
38 <TAB> 39 <TAB> Although the Tiger acquisition has brought Federal a long way toward becoming the global player it wants to be, it also has brought problems.
39 <TAB> 40 <TAB> It more than doubled Federal's long-term debt to $1.9 billion, thrust the company into unknown territory -- heavy cargo -- and suddenly expanded its landing rights to 21 countries from four.
40 <TAB> 41 <TAB> Federal, on its own, hadn't been doing very well overseas.
41 <TAB> 42 <TAB> It had hemorrhaged in its attempt to get into Asia, where treaty restrictions forced it to fly some planes half-empty on certain routes.
42 <TAB> 43 <TAB> On routes to South America, the company had no backup jets to ensure delivery when planes were grounded.
43 <TAB> 44 <TAB> In Europe, business suffered as Federal bought several local companies, only to have the managers quit.
44 <TAB> 45 <TAB> These and other problems squeezed Federal's profit margins last year to 8%, down from more than 13% annually in the first half of the decade.
45 <TAB> 46 <TAB> Earnings have plummeted, too, in each of the past three quarters.
46 <TAB> 48 <TAB> In the fiscal first period ended Aug. 31, profit fell 54% to $30.4 million, or 58 cents a share, mostly because of the Tiger merger, Federal says.
47 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Federal's stock price, however, has held up well, driven in part by the general run-up of airline stocks, analysts say.
48 <TAB> 49 <TAB> Since trading as low as $42.25 a share in May, Federal's shares have rallied as high as $57.87 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
49 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They closed Friday at $53.25, down 50 cents on the day.
50 <TAB> 53 <TAB> There's a certain irony in the fact that Federal Express faces its first union problems as a result of its Tiger purchase.
51 <TAB> 52 <TAB> Tiger itself was founded by a band of gungho airmen who had airlifted supplies "over the Hump" from India to China during World War II.
52 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In the early 1970s, Mr. Smith modeled his fledgling company on Tiger's innovation of hub-and-spoke and containerized-cargo operations.
53 <TAB> 57 <TAB> But from early on, Tiger's workers unionized, while Federal's never have.
54 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Federal Express officials acknowledge mistakes in their drive overseas but say it will pay off eventually.
55 <TAB> 56 <TAB> Analysts expect Federal's earnings to improve again in its fiscal third quarter ending Feb. 28, when the company should begin benefiting from Tiger's extra flights, back-up planes and landing rights.
56 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Until then, they expect the cost of integrating the two carriers to continue crimping profits.
57 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For now, the union issue is the most nettlesome of Federal's Tiger problems, management believes.
58 <TAB> 59 <TAB> Although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers, Mr. Smith doesn't countenance what he considers insubordination.
59 <TAB> 60 <TAB> When a large group of pilots once signed petitions opposing work-rule and compensation changes, he called a meeting in a company hangar and dressed them down for challenging his authority.
60 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He then made most of the changes, pilots say.
61 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That sort of approach, however, hasn't worked since the addition of Tiger.
62 <TAB> 63 <TAB> Its 6,500 workers, who had battled Tiger's management for years over givebacks, were union members until the day of the merger, when most of their unions were automatically decertified.
63 <TAB> 64 <TAB> Soon after the merger, moreover, Federal's management asked Tiger's pilots to sign an agreement stating that they could be fired any time, without cause or notice.
64 <TAB> -1 <TAB> When the pilots refused, the company retracted it.
65 <TAB> 66 <TAB> Mr. Smith angered Federal's pilots, too.
66 <TAB> 68 <TAB> In his haste to seal the deal with Tiger Chairman Saul Steinberg last August, Mr. Smith ignored a promise that he had made to his own pilots three years ago: that any fliers acquired in future mergers would be "end-tailed" -- put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that determines work schedules, pay and career options.
67 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Tiger merger agreement stipulated that the lists be combined on the basis of tenure.
68 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Smith is trying hard to allay the anger.
69 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And even some pro-union pilots say his charisma and popularity among the many former military fliers could be tough to beat. "A lot of people are identifying a vote for representation as a vote against Fred Smith," says J.X. Gollich, a Tiger-turned-Federal pilot and union activist.
70 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Smith and other top Federal executives have met with Tiger workers in Los Angeles, Ohio, New York, Alaska, Asia and Europe.
71 <TAB> 72 <TAB> Recently, they have appeared every few weeks in talk-show type videos, countering pro-union arguments.
72 <TAB> 73 <TAB> In one video, Mr. Smith defended his agreement to merge the pilot-seniority lists.
73 <TAB> 75 <TAB> He said Mr. Steinberg had insisted that the merger talks move quickly.
74 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Regulators, as well, might have quashed the deal if Tiger's pilots hadn't been protected, he said.
75 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Furthermore, Mr. Smith added, "our contract with our pilots says that we will manage our fleet operations with their advice.
76 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It doesn't give any particular group the ability to veto change."
77 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Already, the fight has been costly.
78 <TAB> 79 <TAB> The seniority-list controversy, along with the job-classification dispute, has been turned over to the mediator.
79 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Meanwhile, the company is operating with two separate pilot groups and seniority lists, and that is costing Federal "a big number," says James Barksdale, executive vice president and chief operating officer.
80 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The issue has also cost Federal management a lot of good will among its old pilots. "They were willing to mistreat us because we hadn't shown any moxie, any resistance," says William Queenan, a DC-10 pilot and 14-year Federal veteran.
81 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Adds John Poag, a 727 captain and past chairman of the company-sponsored Flight Advisory Board: "They've made all these magnanimous gestures to the Flying Tiger pilots, and for us, nothing."
82 <TAB> 83 <TAB> Such animosity could prove pivotal in the union vote.
83 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A large majority of the 961 former Tiger fliers support the union, according to a union study.
84 <TAB> 85 <TAB> But though most of the 1,087 Federal pilots are believed opposed, it is unclear just how much their loyalty to Mr. Smith has been eroded.
85 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The fight has turned ugly and, among pilots at least, has shattered the esprit de corps that Mr. Smith worked so hard to build.
86 <TAB> 87 <TAB> Anti-union pilots have held ballot-burning parties.
87 <TAB> 89 <TAB> Some younger pilots say they have had to endure anti-union harangues by senior pilots while flying across the country.
88 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And for now, at least, the competition isn't the only enemy.

1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> As part of the agreement, Goodson also terminated the contract under which Ingersoll manages Goodson's 66 newspapers, ending a long association between the two companies that has turned increasingly bitter recently.
2 <TAB> 4 <TAB> Goodson has accused Ingersoll of paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the St. Louis Sun.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Under the terms of the accord, Ingersoll will pay about $255 million for the Register, a daily that Goodson bought for about $170 million in 1986.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Goodson will pay the additional $20 million in settlement of the management contract.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Goodson also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of Ingersoll to run the Goodson papers.

7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Goodson, which is based here, will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the Morristown Daily Record for $155 million in 1987.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> The New Jersey paper, like the New Haven, Conn., paper, was purchased by Ingersoll on Goodson's behalf as part of the management contract.

11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> David N. Hurwitz, president and chief operating officer of Goodson, said in a telephone interview that the company doesn't currently have any plans to sell additional newspapers.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Goodson said David Carr, former president of Ingersoll Publications, and Ray Cockburn, former senior vice president, would head the new in-house management team at Goodson, which had revenue of $225 million in 1988.
13 <TAB> 17 <TAB> The association between the two companies stretches back thirty years to a friendship between television producer Mark Goodson and Ingersoll founder Ralph Ingersoll.

0 <TAB> 2 <TAB> September's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists, and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market's plunge Friday.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> After falling for three consecutive months, the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9% last month, the Labor Department reported Friday, as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Although the report, which was released before the stock market opened, didn't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, analysts said it did play a role in the market's decline.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Analysts immediately viewed the price data, the grimmest inflation news in months, as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit, the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5% in September, to $145.21 billion.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That rise came on top of a 0.7% gain in August, and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> "I think the Friday report, combined with the actions of the Fed, weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> But economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "The overall 0.9% increase is serious in itself, but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy, the producer price index still increased by 0.7%," said Gordon Richards, an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> But Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis, blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the September jump. "I would say this is not bad news; this is a blip," he said. "The core rate is not really out of line."
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> All year, energy prices have skewed the producer price index, which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace last winter, when a steep run-up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double-digit annual rates.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Energy prices then plummeted through the summer, causing the index to decline for three consecutive months.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Overall, the index has climbed at a 5.1% compound annual rate since the start of the year, the Labor Department said.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> While far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year, that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0% increase for all of 1988.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Moreover, this year's good inflation news may have ended last month, when energy prices zoomed up 6.5% after plunging 7.3% in August.
16 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead, leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain.
17 <TAB> 19 <TAB> Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index, but the 0.9% climb was higher than most anticipated. "I think the resurgence {in inflation} is going to continue for a few months," said John Mueller, chief economist at Bell Mueller Cannon, a Washington economic forecasting firm.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He predicted that inflation will moderate next year, saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, said that last month's rise "isn't as bad an omen" as the 0.9% figure suggests. "If you examine the data carefully, the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices, rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods," he explained.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Passenger car prices jumped 3.8% in September, after climbing 0.5% in August and declining in the late spring and summer.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Many analysts said the September increase was a one-time event, coming as dealers introduced their 1990 models.
22 <TAB> 25 <TAB> Although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations, car prices rose beyond the customary autumn increase.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Prices for capital equipment rose a hefty 1.1% in September, while prices for home electronic equipment fell 1.1%.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Food prices declined 0.6%, after climbing 0.3% in August.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Meanwhile, the retail sales report showed that car sales rose 0.8% in September to $32.82 billion.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices, analysts said.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> Sales at general merchandise stores rose 1.7% after declining 0.6% in August, while sales of building materials fell 1.8% after rising 1.7%.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> Producer prices for intermediate goods grew 0.4% in September, after dropping for three consecutive months.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> Prices for crude goods, an array of raw materials, jumped 1.1% after declining 1.9% in August and edging up 0.2% in July.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Here are the Labor Department's producer price indexes (1982=100) for September, before seasonal adjustment, and the percentage changes from September, 1988.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Time magazine, in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers, is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year, increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways.
1 <TAB> 3 <TAB> In an announcement to its staff last week, executives at Time Warner Inc. 's weekly magazine said Time will "dramatically de-emphasize" its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000, to four million; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $4 to $55.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In a related development, the news-weekly, for the fourth year in a row, said it won't increase its advertising rates in 1990; a full, four-color page in the magazine costs about $120,000.
3 <TAB> 9 <TAB> However, because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered, ad rates will be effectively 7.5% higher per subscriber, according to Richard Heinemann, Time associate publisher.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high, and expensive, circulations is the way to draw advertisers.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In recent years, Reader's Digest, New York Times Co. 's McCall's, and most recently News Corp. 's TV Guide, have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the hyper-competitive world of magazine news-weeklies.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> But Time, as part of the more cost-conscious Time Warner, wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Besides, Time executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky. "Giveaways just give people the wrong image," said Mr. Heinemann. "That perception takes the focus off the magazine."
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers. "What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and don't really read it," said Mr. Heinemann. "We are trying to create quality and involvement."
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> However, Time executives used the same explanation when in October 1988 the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from 4.6 million to 4.3 million.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And Time's paid circulation, according to Audit Bureau of Circulations, dropped 7.3% to 4,393,237 in the six months ended June 30, 1989.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Still, Time's move is being received well, once again. "It's terrific for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more," said Michael Drexler, national media director at Bozell Inc. ad agency. "A few drops in circulation are of no consequence.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It's not a show of weakness; they are improving the quality of circulation while insuring their profits."
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Heinemann said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry: a magazine's net revenue per subscriber, or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away. "The question is how much are we getting from each reader," said Mr. Heinemann.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Time's rivals news-weeklies, Washington Post Co. 's Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report, are less reliant on electronic giveaways, and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for 1990 within a month.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Many of the nation's highest-ranking executives saluted Friday's market plunge as an overdue comeuppance for speculators and takeover players.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Assuming that the market doesn't head into a bottomless free fall, some executives think Friday's action could prove a harbinger of good news -- as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be abating. "This is a reaction to artificial LBO valuations, rather than to any fundamentals," said John Young, chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co., whose shares dropped $3.125 to $48.125. "If we get rid of a lot of that nonsense, it will be a big plus."
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the Business Council, a group that meets to discuss national issues, were only too happy to personalize their criticism. "People wish the government would do something about leveraged buy-outs, do something about takeovers, do something about Donald Trump," said Rand Araskog, chairman of ITT Corp., whose stock dropped $3.375. "Where's the leadership?
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Where's the guy who can say: `Enough is enough'"?
4 <TAB> 7 <TAB> The executives were remarkably unperturbed by the plunge even though it lopped billions of dollars off the value of their companies -- and millions off their personal fortunes.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "I'm not going to worry about one day's decline," said Kenneth Olsen, Digital Equipment Corp. president, who was leisurely strolling through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the mountains here after his company's shares plunged $5.75 to close at $86.50. "I didn't bother calling anybody; I didn't even turn on TV."
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "There hasn't been any fundamental change in the economy," added John Smale, whose Procter & Gamble Co. took an $8.75 slide to close at $120.75. "The fact that this happened two years ago and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this won't be a problem."
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Of course, established corporate managements often tend to applaud the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists.

12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> He's attacked the concept of "building tenure," one of the most disgraceful institutions in American public schools.

2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Two of the four big thrifts were sold to NCNB Corp., Charlotte, N.C., which has aggressively expanded its markets, particularly in Texas and Florida.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> A Canadian bank bought another thrift, in the first RTC transaction with a foreign bank.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Under these deals, the RTC sells just the deposits and the healthy assets.

0 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Britain's current account deficit dropped to #1.6 billion ($2.56 billion) in September from an adjusted #2 billion ($3.21 billion) the previous month, but the improvement comes amid increasing concern that a recession could strike the U.K. economy next year.
1 <TAB> 4 <TAB> The Confederation of British Industry's latest survey shows that business executives expect a pronounced slowdown, largely because of a 16-month series of interest-rate increases that has raised banks' base lending rates to 15%.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> "The outlook has deteriorated since the summer, with orders and employment falling and output at a standstill," said David Wigglesworth, chairman of the industry group's economic committee.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He also said investment by businesses is falling off.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Of 1,224 companies surveyed, 31% expect to cut spending on plant equipment and machinery, while only 28% plan to spend more.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> But despite mounting recession fears, government data don't yet show the economy grinding to a halt.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Unemployment, for example, has continued to decline, and the September trade figures showed increases in both imports and exports.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> As a result, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government isn't currently expected to ease interest rates before next spring, if then.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson views the high rates as his chief weapon against inflation, which was ignited by tax cuts and loose credit policies in 1986 and 1987.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Officials fear that any loosening this year could rekindle inflation or further weaken the pound against other major currencies.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Fending off attacks on his economic policies in a House of Commons debate yesterday, Mr. Lawson said inflation "remains the greatest threat to our economic well-being" and promised to take "whatever steps are needed" to choke it off.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The latest government figures said retail prices in September were up 7.6% from a year earlier.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Many economists have started predicting a mild recession next year.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> David Owen, U.K. economist with Kleinwort Benson Group, reduced his growth forecast for 1990 to 0.7% from 1.2% and termed the risk of recession next year "quite high." But he said the downturn probably won't become a "major contraction" similar to those of 1974 and 1982.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Still, Britain's current slump is a cause for concern here as the nation joins in the European Community's plan to create a unified market by 1992.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Compared with the major economies on the Continent, the U.K. faces both higher inflation and lower growth in the next several months.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> As a result, Mr. Owen warned, investment will be more likely to flow toward the other European economies and "the U.K. will be less prepared for the single market."
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Britain's latest trade figures contained some positive news for the economy, such as a surge in the volume of exports, which were 8.5% higher than a year earlier.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> But while September exports rose to #8.43 billion, imports shot up to #10.37 billion.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> The resulting #1.9 billion merchandise trade deficit was partly offset by an assumed surplus of #300 million in so-called invisible items, which include income from investments, services and official transfers.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Despite the narrowing of the monthly trade gap, economists expect the current account deficit for all of 1989 to swell to about #20 billion from #14.6 billion in 1988.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Increasingly, economists say the big deficit reflects the slipping competitive position of British industry. "When the country gets wealthier, we tend to buy high-quality imports," Mr. Owen said.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> General Electric Co. executives and lawyers provided "misleading and false" information to the Pentagon in 1985 in an effort to cover up "longstanding fraudulent" billing practices, federal prosecutors alleged in legal briefs.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> The government's startling allegations, filed only days before the scheduled start of a criminal overcharge trial against GE in Philadelphia federal district court, challenge the motives and veracity of the nation's third-largest defense contractor.
2 <TAB> 5 <TAB> In a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made in the same court yesterday, GE asserted that "prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses, distorted documents and ignored important facts." The company attacked the government's allegations as "reckless and baseless mudslinging," and said its management "promptly and accurately reported" to the Pentagon all relevant information about billing practices.
3 <TAB> 8 <TAB> The case strikes at the corporate image of GE, which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified design work on the Strategic Defense Initiative, and could cause a loss of future defense contracts if Pentagon and Justice Department officials take a tough stance.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The company has been considered an industry leader in advocating cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> But the government now claims that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy over five years to obscure from federal authorities the extent and details of "widespread" fraudulent billing practices.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> The problems were uncovered during a series of internal investigations of the company's Space Systems division, which has been the focus of two separate overcharge prosecutions by the government since 1985.
7 <TAB> 9 <TAB> The dispute stems from pretrial maneuvering in the pending court case, in which prosecutors have been demanding access to a host of internal company memos, reports and documents.
8 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Last November, a federal grand jury indicted GE on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme to defraud the Army of $21 million on a logistics computer contract.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The company, for its part, maintains that many of the disputed documents are privileged attorney-client communications that shouldn't be turned over to prosecutors.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A hearing is scheduled on the issue today.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> The government's 136-page filing covers events leading up to the current case and an earlier indictment in March 1985, when GE was accused of defrauding the Pentagon by illegally claiming cost overruns on Minuteman missile contracts.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> GE pleaded guilty and paid a fine of more than $1 million in the Minuteman case, which involved some of the same individuals and operations that are at the center of the dispute in the Philadelphia court.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> In order to show that all of its units had corrected billing problems and therefore should become eligible again for new contracts, prosecutors contend that "high-level GE executives" and company lawyers provided "misleading statements" to then-Air Force Secretary Verne Orr and other Pentagon officials during a series of meetings in 1985.
14 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Overall, the government contends that GE's disclosure efforts largely were intended to "curry favor" with Pentagon officials without detailing the extent of the management lapses and allegedly pervasive billing irregularities uncovered by company investigations.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Prosecutors depict a company that allegedly sat on damaging evidence of overcharges from 1983 to 1985, despite warnings from an internal auditor.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> When GE finally disclosed the problems, prosecutors contend that Mr. Orr "was erroneously informed that the {suspected} practices had only just been discovered" by GE management.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> In its brief, the government asserted that it needs the internal GE documents to rebut anticipated efforts by GE during the trial to demonstrate "its good corporate character."
18 <TAB> 20 <TAB> GE, which was surprised by the last-minute subpoena for more than 100 boxes and file cabinets of documents, countered that senior GE managers didn't find out about questionable billing practices until 1985, and that the information was passed on quickly to Mr. Orr at his first meeting with company representatives.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Subsequent meetings, initiated after the company and two of its units were briefly suspended from federal contracts, were held to familiarize Mr. Orr with the company's self-policing procedures and to disclose additional information, according to GE.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> GE's filing contends that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The company's conduct "does not even raise a question of wrongful corporate intent, ratification or cover-up," GE's brief asserts. "On the contrary, it shows a corporation reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely uncharted waters."
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Orr couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.

4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If mutation and natural selection slowly but surely give rise to more and more advanced forms of life, then it was only a matter of eons before splendid beings endowed with reason, self-awareness and taste shimmered onto the scene.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Now along comes Stephen Jay Gould to dash this flattering illusion.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> His credentials are excellent for the task.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Star lecturer at Harvard, author of numerous popular books on science, and scourge of the creationist lobby, Mr. Gould is perhaps the world's most eminent evolutionary theorist.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Yet he puts quite a twist on the old story handed down from Darwin.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> For him, natural history is anything but a gradual, predictable march from primordial slime to human consciousness; it is a careening, chaotic affair in which the emergence of a featherless biped was a one-in-a-million shot.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In "Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History" (Norton, 326 pages, $19.95), Mr. Gould makes his case for "the awesome improbability of human evolution." The argument turns on the discovery in 1909 of an amazing fossil quarry high in the Canadian Rockies called the Burgess Shale.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Here, in an area smaller than a city block, lay buried traces of countless weird creatures that had frolicked more than 500 million years ago -- creatures whose anatomical variety far exceeded what can be found in all the world's oceans today.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Such an embarrassment of riches was inconceivable to the man who discovered the Burgess Shale, one Charles Doolittle Walcott.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The received Darwinian wisdom of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design, limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary species.
14 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Accordingly, the hidebound traditionalist reconstructed hypothetical organisms from the Burgess fossils in such a way that they could be shoehorned into familiar categories.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It was not until the early 1970s that Cambridge Prof.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Harry Whittington and two sharp graduate students began to publish a reinterpretation of the Burgess Shale.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> By making clever inferences about how the squashed and distorted fossil remains corresponded to three-dimensional structures, this trio was able to piece together a series of wondrous beasties quite unlike anything currently on the planet.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> One was so fantastic in appearance, it was dubbed Hallucigenia.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Would that Mr. Gould's minute descriptions of these creatures was always so colorful.
20 <TAB> 22 <TAB> A good deal of the book is boring, particularly the endless allusions to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes festooning the text.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> These turns do not provide sufficient relief from sentences like, "Most modern chelicerates have six uniramous appendages on the prosoma."
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Interest picks up, though, when Mr. Gould gets around to discussing the meaning of the Burgess oddities for the theory of evolution.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> Not long after the appearance of life, evidently, there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs seen on the earth.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The vast majority of them, however, were wiped out by a succession of environmental upheavals that were too sudden and catastrophic for the normal rules of natural selection to operate.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Consequently, the winnowing process was like a lottery "in which each group {held} a ticket unrelated to its anatomical virtues." So much for survival of the fittest.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> So much, too, for the notion that we humans triumphed in the Darwinian struggle by evolving big brains.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Our mammalian forerunners lucked out through the extraterrestrial impact that did in the dinosaurs because they were small, not smart.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If anyone has difficulty imagining a world in which history went merrily on without us, Mr. Gould sketches several.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In one, birds are the dominant carnivores; in another the seas abound with "little penises."
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Back when the Burgess fauna were flourishing, it seems, human evolutionary hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a backbone called Pikaia.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Gould finds this oddly exhilarating; like an existentialist of old, he views our contingency as "a source of both freedom and consequent moral responsibility." I, by contrast, cannot help feeling that if some other curiosity from the Burgess Shale had survived instead, beings at once wiser and less boorish than Homo sapiens might have eventually gained earthly dominion.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But even if no conscious life had evolved here at all, the universe is a big place, and given the right conditions, sympathetic to creating some form of life.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Surely at some other cosmic address a Gouldoid creature would have risen out of the ooze to explain why, paleontologically speaking, "it is, indeed, a wonderful life."

5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Since then she has become wealthy.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Her husband and older son -- a computer prodigy profiled in The Wall Street Journal in 1981, when he was 13 -- run a software company with expected sales this year of $10 million.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Most recently, she has become the publisher of Movieline, a four-year-old Los Angeles magazine that began national distribution last month, with an initial press run of 100,000 copies.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Distributed by the Hearst Corp. 's Eastern News, the glossy publication melds Vanity Fair's gossipy archness and Premiere's earnest delving into behind-the-scenes minutiae, with a special emphasis on Tinseltown as fashion trendsetter.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It's being sold through bookstores, newsstands and some video stores.
10 <TAB> 23 <TAB> Though Ms. Volokh is a small woman, she has an outsized personality and dramatic flair that seem perfectly suited to capitalism as it is practiced in Hollywood.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Certainly life for her has changed considerably since the days in Kiev, when she lived with her parents, her husband and her two sons in a 2 1/2-room apartment in what she calls "silent internal immigration," dreaming of escape.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Now, for example, she owns 48 hats.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> However, she remembers the lean years and recalls with relish wearing her
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> first major American purchase -- that turban -- 10 years later and having a Los
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Angeles boutique owner ask her if it was a Chanel. With obvious satisfaction,
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> she says she told him: "No darling, I just give it a Chanel look." She keeps
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> track of the rest of her hats by stapling Polaroid snapshots to the outside of
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> each hatbox.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Are the hats merely part of her new L.A. persona, along with the many ultra-thin Capri cigarettes she smokes, the parties she throws for 500 people, the Chekovian feasts she offers guests at her weekend place in Santa Barbara?
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "No, darling," she said recently in her fluent, slightly affected English, during a trip East to promote Movieline's national expansion. "You have to be born with it.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> I used to wear hats in Russia, but I had to make them and my dresses.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> On the hat side I wasn't getting what I wanted."
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> Now 48 years old, Ms. Volokh has definite ideas about what she wants.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> At Movieline, she wants "specific paragraphing, specific tone, a specific attitude -- bright and bold and tongue-in-cheek." In restaurants (in this case, the Russian Samovar, a New York restaurant operated by and for Soviet emigres), she didn't want the chirpy, folkish music bouncing through the room. "You people here think this is Russian music," she said with disdain, and called over to the waitress: "Could you turn it off?"
25 <TAB> 39 <TAB> That done, Ms. Volokh spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes she feels she was born with: an understanding of food, business, Russian culture, human nature, and parties. "Parties are rather a state of mind," she said, pausing only to taste and pass judgment on the Georgian shashlik ("a little well done, but very good"). "If you are born to give parties, you give parties.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> Even in Russia we managed to give parties.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> In Los Angeles, in our lean years, we gave parties."
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> As publisher of a magazine devoted to movies as guideposts for fashion and other fantasies, Ms. Volokh sees her party-giving as an important part of business.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> She has thrown extravagant soirees for crowds of people, but prefers more intimate gatherings. "At American cocktail parties everyone's always looking over your shoulder to see who they can talk to next.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> I like rather tea, because it is at the end of the day." She serves high Russian tea, at 5 p.m. "It's supposed to be later but I just moved it.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In Los Angeles, it's important to catch people just after work."
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> She also frequently invites directors, producers, actors, writers and other show business people for "coffee and clips in the pleasure dome." Guests bring movies on tape, and show their favorite three-to-five minute segments on the screen that unrolls from the ceiling of the Volokhs' art-nouveau library ("the pleasure dome").
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They eat "sinful and sensual things" -- and explain their clips. "It's very revealing and soul baring," said Ms. Volokh.
34 <TAB> 35 <TAB> The idea for Movieline actually was dreamed up by an old friend of the Volokhs, Boris Krutchensky (who has the title of co-publisher), and Laurie Halpern Smith, now the magazine's co-editor.
35 <TAB> 36 <TAB> Mr. Krutchensky approached Ms. Volokh five years ago about backing the publication, which started out as a listing guide.
36 <TAB> 38 <TAB> She was interested only if she could guide it editorially as well. "Anne doesn't believe in blandness," said Ms. Smith. "She wants things to be exciting.
37 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And she has this inexhaustible energy.
38 <TAB> -1 <TAB> She'll think of an idea the editorial people think is impossible, then she'll have us make it work."
39 <TAB> 47 <TAB> In fact, Ms. Volokh wasn't just a rich lady who needed a hobby.
40 <TAB> 41 <TAB> Back in the Soviet Union she was a respected journalist, writing a weekly column about the national cuisine for Sunday Izvestia.
41 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Those columns -- vivid discussions of the cultural and literary reverberations of food as well as practical advice on how to glamorize dreary Sovietized meals -- became the basis for her erudite and entertaining cookbook, "The Art of Russian Cuisine," brought out in 1983 by Macmillan Publishing Co.
42 <TAB> 44 <TAB> "I don't trust people who don't eat," said Ms. Volokh, though she herself stopped eating lunch a few years ago to drop 25 pounds. "Look at Dostoevski and Kafka.
43 <TAB> -1 <TAB> No one ever eats in their books and look at them. . . . Tolstoy's characters eat, Pushkin's, Gogol's." In her cookbook, which Macmillan is bringing out in soft cover this month (with the blini recipe revised so it works), she introduces each chapter with appropriate quotations from Russian literature: Pushkin on blini, Goncharov on piroghi.
44 <TAB> 45 <TAB> In life, she offers practical dieting advice: "Divide your meals into important and unimportant.
45 <TAB> 46 <TAB> In a great restaurant, don't deprive yourself.
46 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The other meals don't matter."
47 <TAB> 48 <TAB> Amusing as she is, and frivolous as she can seem, this is a serious person with some difficult memories.
48 <TAB> -1 <TAB> She was the child of relative privilege.
49 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Her mother was a translator; her father was "the eternal vice director."
50 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "I emigrated to wear better hats, do better parties," she said with a giggle. "But we shouldn't leave out political reasons, number one.
51 <TAB> -1 <TAB> You try to maintain your dignity under difficult circumstances.
52 <TAB> -1 <TAB> One cannot imagine how you live when you live those double and triple lives."
53 <TAB> 55 <TAB> By 1973, after their second child was born, it had become clear to Ms. Volokh and her husband Vladimir, a computer scientist, that they wanted to leave the U.S.S.R. Ms. Volokh quit her job, to remove herself from the public eye.
54 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The wait was miserable.
55 <TAB> 57 <TAB> Before granting Ms. Volokh's parents a visa, the government required her mother to obtain permission from her first husband, whom she had divorced 38 years earlier.
56 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Volokh was fired from his job, and had to endure hours of organized verbal abuse from his co-workers, accusations of sabotage and counterrevolutionary activities.
57 <TAB> 59 <TAB> The Volokhs were afraid that they'd end up like a friend of theirs who'd applied for a visa and waited for 10 years, having been demoted from his profession of theoretical mathematician to shipping clerk.
58 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They didn't.
59 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Their visa came in relatively short order, and they moved to Los Angeles.
60 <TAB> 61 <TAB> Mr. Volokh soon found work in his field, but Ms. Volokh refused the obvious and available occupation-as translatorfor a Russian who spoke fluent English. "That's always looking back," she said. "I wanted to be in business." On the way to that goal, she received her first U.S. paycheck for proofreading a book of Polish poetry, attended secretarial school, then went to work for a fund-raising organization.
61 <TAB> 62 <TAB> Soon she was running the office.
62 <TAB> -1 <TAB> When her husband and son founded their computer company, Vesoft, she worked as business manager, bookkeeper and publicist.
63 <TAB> 64 <TAB> Now Movieline is located in the same building as Vesoft. "Things work out unexpectedly in life," said Ms. Volokh. "You never know if you'll be chosen to be the scapegoat or the lucky one.
64 <TAB> -1 <TAB> We were lucky."

0 <TAB> 27 <TAB> Wall Street is just about ready to line the bird cage with paper stocks.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> For three years, a healthy economy and the export-boosting effects of a weak dollar propelled sales and earnings of the big paper companies to record levels.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> As the good times rolled they more than doubled their prices for pulp, a raw material used in all sorts of paper, to $830 a metric ton this past spring from $380 a ton at the start of 1986.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But now the companies are getting into trouble because they undertook a record expansion program while they were raising prices sharply.
4 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Third-quarter profits fell at several companies.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "Put your money in a good utility or bank stock, not a paper company," advises George Adler of Smith Barney.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Other analysts are nearly as pessimistic.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Gary Palmero of Oppenheimer & Co. expects a 30% decline in earnings between now and 1991 for "commodity-oriented" paper companies, which account for the majority of the industry.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Robert Schneider of Duff & Phelps sees paper-company stock prices falling 10% to 15% in 1990, perhaps 25% if there's a recession.
9 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Paper companies concede that business has been off recently.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But they attribute much of the weakness to customer inventory reductions.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Generally they maintain that, barring a recession and a further strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies, the industry isn't headed for a prolonged slump. "It won't be an earthshaking drop," a Weyerhaeuser spokesman says.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Last week Mr. Adler lowered his rating from hold to "avoid" on Boise Cascade, Champion International, Great Northern Nekoosa, International Paper, Louisiana Pacific and Weyerhaeuser.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Oppenheimer's Mr. Palmero, meanwhile, is steering clear of Gaylord Container, Stone Container and Federal Paper Board.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Schneider is cool to Georgia Pacific and Abitibi-Price.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Lawrence Ross of PaineWebber would avoid Union Camp.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The companies in question believe the analysts are too pessimistic.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Great Northern Nekoosa said, "The odds of the dire predictions about us being right are small." International Paper emphasizes that it is better positioned than most companies for the coming overcapacity because its individual mills can make more than one grade of paper.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A Boise-Cascade spokesman referred to a speech by Chairman John Fery, in which he said that markets generally are stable, although some risk of further price deterioration exists.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Stone Container Chairman Roger Stone said that, unlike for some other paper products, demand for Stone's principal commodity, unbleached containerboard, remains strong.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> He expects the price for that product to rise even more next year.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Gaylord Container said analysts are skeptical of it because it's carrying a lot of debt.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Champion International said, "We've gotten our costs down and we're better positioned for any cyclical downturn than we've ever been."
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Louisiana Pacific and Georgia Pacific said a number of other analysts are recommending them because of their strong wood-products business.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Federal Paper Board said, "We're not as exposed as the popular perception of us." The company explained that its main product, bleached paperboard, which goes into some advertising materials and white boxes, historically doesn't have sharp price swings.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Because the stock prices of some paper companies already reflect an expected profit slump, PaineWebber's Mr. Ross says he thinks that next year the share prices of some companies may fall at most only 5% to 10%.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A company such as Federal Paper Board may be overly discounted and looks "tempting" to him, he says, though he isn't yet recommending the shares.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Wall Street isn't avoiding everything connected with paper.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Palmero recommends Temple-Inland, explaining that it is "virtually the sole major paper company not undergoing a major capacity expansion," and thus should be able to lower long-term debt substantially next year.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A Temple-Inland spokesman said the company expects record earnings in 1989, and "we're still pretty bullish" on 1990.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The analysts say their gloomy forecasts have a flip side.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> Some take a warm view of consumer-oriented paper companies, which buy pulp from the commodity producers and should benefit from the expected declines in pulp prices.
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> Estimates on how much pulp prices will fall next year currently run between $150 and $250 a metric ton.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> Analysts agree that the price drop should especially benefit the two big tissue makers, Scott Paper and Kimberly-Clark.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A spokesman for Scott says that assuming the price of pulp continues to soften, "We should do well."

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> When Justice William Brennan marks the start of his 34th year on the Supreme Court today, the occasion will differ sharply from previous anniversaries of his tenure.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For the first time, the 83-year-old justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent, rather than as a force in the high court's majority.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This role reversal holds true, as well, for his three liberal and moderate allies, Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun and John Stevens.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> But are these four players, three of them in their 80s, ready to assume a different role after 88 years, collectively, of service on the high court?
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role, and the frustrations that go with it, but in different ways.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Justices Brennan and Stevens appear philosophical about it; Justices Marshall and Blackmun appear fighting mad.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> The four justices are no newcomers to dissent, often joining forces in the past decade to criticize the court's conservative drift.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> But always, in years past, they have bucked the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to eke out a number of major victories in civil rights and liberties cases.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Now, however, as the court's new five-member conservative majority continues to solidify, victories for the liberals are rare.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> The change is most dramatic for Justice Brennan, the last survivor of the mid-1960s liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967, the height of the Warren Court's power, Justice Brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Last term alone he cast 52 dissenting votes in 133 decisions, with the contentious flag-burning ruling as his only big victory.
12 <TAB> 16 <TAB> But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role, strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech. "Each time the court revisits an issue, the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result," he said.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Moreover, in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s, he knew that the tables might turn in the future.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt, a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the Warren Court's opinions.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Associates of 81-year-old Justice Marshall say he was "depressed" about the court's direction last spring, but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court's cutbacks in civil rights. "We could sweep it under the rug and hide it, but I'm not going to do it," he said in a speech last month.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He, like Justice Brennan, considers dissents highly important for the future, a point that hasn't escaped legal scholars.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says there is a "generation-skipping" flavor to current dissents.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The dissenters in the Warren Court, he says, appeared to be writing for the short-term, suggesting that the court's direction might change soon. "Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future," he says.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Justice Blackmun, who will turn 81 next month, also seems feisty about his new role.
20 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Associates say he takes some defeats more personally than his colleagues, especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion first recognized in his 1973 opinion, Roe vs.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Wade.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> Friends and associates who saw Justice Blackmun during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> And his outlook improved after successful cataract surgery in August.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But his level of frustration showed in a recent, impassioned speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in Chicago.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He concluded his remarks by quoting, emotionally and at some length, according to those present, the late Martin Luther King's famous "I Have a Dream" speech from the 1963 March on Washington.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Justice Stevens, 69, is probably the most philosophical of the dissenters about his role, in part because he may be the least liberal of the four, but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If the role these four dissenters are assuming is a familiar one in modern Supreme Court history, it also differs in an important way from recent history, court watchers say. "The dissenters of the Warren Court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited," says Prof.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A.E. Dick Howard of the University of Virginia Law School, "but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created."

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> The U.S., which is finalizing its steel-import quotas, is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Meanwhile, the U.S. has negotiated a significant cut in Japan's steel quota, and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the European Community.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Brazil, similar to Mexico and South Korea, is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas, which expired Sept. 30.
3 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Brazil and Venezuela are the only two countries that haven't completed steel talks with the U.S. for the year ending Oct. 1, 1990.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> In recent years, U.S. steelmakers have supplied about 80% of the 100 million tons of steel used annually by the nation.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Of the remaining 20% needed, the steel-quota negotiations allocate about 15% to foreign suppliers, with the difference supplied mainly by Canada -- which isn't included in the quota program.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Other countries that don't have formal steel quotas with the U.S., such as Taiwan, Sweden and Argentina, also have supplied steel.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the U.S. that are similar to quotas.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> The Bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas, known as voluntary restraint agreements, until March 31, 1992.
9 <TAB> 11 <TAB> It also said it would use that two-and-a-half year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade, which has been notoriously managed, subsidized and protected by governments.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The U.S. termed its plan, a "trade liberalization program," despite the fact that it is merely an extension.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Mexico, which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the U.S., virtually doubled its quota to 0.95% of the U.S. steel market from 0.48% under the previous quotas.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> South Korea, which had 1.9% under the previous quotas, is set to get a small increase to about 1.95%.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> That increase rises to slightly more than 2% of the U.S. market if a joint Korean-U.S. steel project is included.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Meanwhile, Brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the 1.43% share it has had in recent years.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> The EC and Japan -- the U.S.'s largest steel suppliers -- haven't been filling their quotas to the full extent.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> The EC steel industry, which has been coping with strong European demand, has been supplying about 5% of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7%.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Japan has been shipping steel to total about 4.5% of the U.S. market compared with a quota of 5.9%.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> In the recent talks, the EC had its quota increased about 300,000 tons, to 7% of the U.S. market from 6.7% in 1988.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> But its quota has been as high as 6.9% in 1984.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Japan, however, has agreed to cut its quota to about 5% from 5.9% previously.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Japan, the EC, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea provide about 80% of the steel imported to the U.S. under the quota program.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters, such as Australia and Venezuela.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> The U.S. had about an extra 2% of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> That was essentially made up of a 1% increase in the overall quota program and 1% from cutting Japan's allowance.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> Negotiators from the White House trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another 1% of the U.S. steel market to allocate.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> These optional 1%-a-year increases to the steel quota program are built into the Bush administration's steel-quota program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and protectionism from their own steel industries.

0 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Federal drug regulators, concerned over British reports that diabetics have died after shifting from animal to human-based insulin, say they are considering a study to see if similar deaths have occurred here.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The United Kingdom reports came from Dr. Patrick Toseland, head of clinical chemistry at Guy's Hospital in London.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> In a telephone interview Friday, Dr. Toseland said the number of sudden, unexplained deaths of diabetics he had seen this year was 17 compared with just two in 1985.
3 <TAB> 5 <TAB> At least six of the deaths occurred among relatively young diabetics who had switched from animal to human insulin within the past year, he said.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Dr. Solomon Sobel, director of metabolism and endrocrine drug products for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said FDA officials have discussed Dr. Toseland's findings "fairly intensively." While there have been no reports of similar sudden unexplained deaths among diabetics in the U.S., Dr. Sobel said the FDA plans to examine Dr. Toseland's evidence and is considering its own study here.
5 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Dr. Toseland, a toxicologist, said he was preparing an article for a British forensic medical journal raising the possibility that the deaths may have occurred after human insulin blunted critical warning signs indicating hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, which can kill diabetics.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> The usual warning signs of hypoglycemia include sweating, anxiety and cramps.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> With proper warning, diabetics can easily raise their blood sugar to safe levels by eating sugar or sugary food. "The anecdotal data certainly shows that some of the people were not aware of the rapid onset of hypoglycemia," Dr. Toseland said.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> At the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Dr. Robert E. Silverman, chief of the diabetes program branch, said no evidence of unexpected deaths from hypoglycemia had shown up in a study of 1,500 diabetics that has been under way at NIH for five years.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> However, he said officials conducting the study hadn't been looking for signs of problems related to hypoglycemia unawareness. "We are now monitoring for it much more closely," he said.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> "We do know there are slight differences in the way human and animal insulins drive down blood sugar," Dr. Sobel said.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The human-based drug starts the blood sugar dropping sooner and drives it down faster, he said. "But we don't believe there is enough of a difference to be clinically significant," Dr. Sobel said.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Reports of Dr. Toseland's findings in the British press have triggered widespread concern among diabetics there.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Both the British Diabetic Association and the Committee on Safety in Medicines -- Britain's equivalent of the U.S. FDA -- recently issued statements noting the lack of hard scientific evidence to support Dr. Toseland's findings.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> On Friday, the American Diabetes Association issued a similar statement urging the six million U.S. diabetics not to overreact to the British report.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "A loss of the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia is a complex problem that is very unlikely to be due simply to the type of insulin used," the American association said.
16 <TAB> 20 <TAB> The FDA already requires drug manufacturers to include warnings with insulin products that symptoms of hypoglycemia are less pronounced with human insulin than with animal-based products.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Eli Lilly & Co., the Indianapolis-based drug manufacturer, dominates the U.S. human insulin market with its product known as Humulin.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> Lilly is building plants to make the insulin in Indianapolis and Fagershein, France.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In its latest annual report, Lilly said Humulin sales have shown "excellent growth."
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Lilly officials said they had seen reports of hypoglycemic unawareness among some patients making the shift from animal to human insulin, but didn't know if the problem had caused any deaths.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Dr. Leigh Thompson, a Lilly group vice president, said the company's clinical trials of both its animal and human-based insulins indicated no difference in the level of hypoglycemia between users of either product.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> Dr. Toseland said most of the British diabetics who died had been taking a human-based insulin made by Novo/Nordisk, a Danish manufacturer.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> None of the diabetics were using Lilly's insulin.

12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> As for the current period, Mr. Gumucio said, "We anticipate that fourth-quarter revenue and earnings will be substantially greater than any of the preceding three quarters, but not up to the record levels of last year's fourth quarter" when Cray earned $88.5 million, or $2.80 a share.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> He added that the company expects "strong" operating profit for the year, "but at a level significantly lower than last year." He said 1989's net income could be 11% to 13% of revenue, which, assuming current expectations, would be 40% to 45% below 1988's level.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Last year, Cray earned $156.6 million, or $4.99 a share, on revenue of $756.3 million.

16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Noting that Cray doesn't have a low-end supercomputer to compete with the likes of Convex Computer Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., Mr. Luber said such a machine would be necessary "to get things back on line here."

1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Although the half-hour situation comedy seen Mondays at 9:30 p.m. Eastern and Pacific time isn't a candidate for cancellation, it is slated for fine-tuning and by next week the network may announce "Teddy Z" is moving to 8:30 p.m. from its 9:30 time slot, replacing "The People Next Door," which became the first network show to be canceled this season.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> "Teddy Z," which centers on a mailroom clerk-turned agent at a Hollywood talent agency, was scheduled in the coveted 9:30 p.m. slot to follow "Murphy Brown," a situation comedy about a television news magazine, starring Candice Bergen. "Teddy Z" was boosted by favorable reviews and a network-wide promotional tie-in contest with K mart Corp.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> California legislators, searching for ways to pay for the $4 billion to $6 billion in damages from last week's earthquake, are laying the groundwork for a temporary increase in the state's sales tax.
1 <TAB> 4 <TAB> The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from Congress on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in California's earthquake relief efforts.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> The state had sought as much as $4.1 billion in relief, but yesterday the House approved a more general scaled-back measure calling for $2.85 billion in aid, the bulk of which would go to California, with an unspecified amount going to regions affected by Hurricane Hugo.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That leaves the state roughly $2 billion to $4 billion short.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> A sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest to raise funds in a hurry.
5 <TAB> 7 <TAB> According to the state department of finance, a one-penny increase in the state's six-cent per dollar sales tax could raise $3 billion.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Willie Brown, speaker of California's Assembly, said that Gov. George Deukmejian has agreed to schedule a special session of the legislature within two weeks.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> California's so-called Gann limit effectively prevents the state from spending new tax money and so drastically limits its options in an emergency.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Both Mr. Brown, the state's most influential legislator, and Gov. Deukmejian favor a temporary sales tax increase -- should more money be needed than the state can raise from existing sources and the federal government.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> According to a spokesman, the governor is also studying the possibility of raising state gasoline taxes.
10 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Mr. Brown, meanwhile, believes "only one tax will be feasible, and it will be a one-penny sales tax increase," said Chuck Dalldorf, an aide.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> One immediate source of money is an emergency fund set up by Gov. Deukmejian.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> The fund has about $1 billion and is set up to handle "precisely the kind of emergency" the state faces, said Tom Beermann, the Governor's deputy press secretary.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> But the fund's size is disputed by Mr. Brown's office, which estimates the fund holds from $630 million to $800 million.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Moreover, an aide to Mr. Brown said Gov. Deukmejian "has expressed a desire not to spend all the reserve on this."
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> To push through a sales tax increase, however, the state will have to suspend the Gann limit, citing an emergency.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> And then it will be required to lower taxes by a corresponding amount during a three-year period after the temporary tax increase ends, said Cindy Katz, assistant director of the state department of finance.
17 <TAB> 21 <TAB> A sales tax increase would require two-thirds approval in both houses of the state's legislature.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But observers expect broad support. "If there's an emergency and there aren't sufficient funds from elsewhere, I think the attitude will be supportive," said Kirk West, president of the California Chamber of Commerce.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But others think property owners ought to pay a higher portion of the state's earthquake relief tab.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Since the late 1970s, California property owners have benefited from a tax rollback as a result of a state ballot initiative known as Proposition 13.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> The state could also increase gasoline taxes; every one penny increase in the tax would yield $11 million a month.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> But Gov. Deukmejian and others are reluctant to do anything to harm the state's chances of sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> To raise more highway funds, a measure to double the state's nine-cent a gallon tax over five years is set to appear on the state's June election ballot.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But some fear imposing a temporary gasoline tax increase in the meantime could undercut support among voters for the measure.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Not everyone is convinced the state must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs. "It's possible, though not probable," that the state could get by with its existing resources and federal help, said Quentin Kopp, chairman of the state senate's transportation committee.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> Separately, two men injured in last week's earthquake-triggered freeway collapse in Oakland began a legal battle against the state over whether officials adequately heeded warnings about the structure's safety.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> The claims, which were filed with the State Board of Control but will probably end up in court, are the first arising out of the collapse of the so-called Cypress structure viaduct.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The men can defeat immunities that states often assert in court by showing that officials knew or should have known that design of the structure was defective and that they failed to make reasonable changes.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A Board of Control spokesman said the board had not seen the claim and declined to comment.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Federal investigators have identified the problem in last July's crash of a United Airlines flight in Iowa: a structural flaw that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> For several months, officials at the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have suspected that a metallurgical flaw in the disk led to a crack that ultimately caused the tail engine to break apart in flight.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> The explosion sent shards of metal flying, severing the DC-10's hydraulic or control systems, and led to the crash that killed 112 people.
3 <TAB> 6 <TAB> But investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent retrieval of a big chunk of Flight 232's tail engine from a cornfield near the Sioux City Airport in Iowa.

7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Anthony Broderick, the FAA's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance, said that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate that a flaw -- known as "hard alpha" -- occurred in the titanium during its production almost 20 years ago.

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> When the good fairy assigned to Slovakia hovered over the cradle of Edita Gruberova many years ago in Bratislava, she sprinkled her with high E flats, sparkling Ds, clean trills, and coloratura ornaments silvery as magic dust.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Maybe she could drop by at the Metropolitan Opera and bring along what she forgot, a little charm, a few smidgins of thespian skills and a nice wig.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Cast as Violetta Valery in a new production of Verdi's "La Traviata," Ms. Gruberova last week did many things nicely and others not so well.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It isn't every day that we hear a Violetta who can sing the first act's high-flying music with all the little notes perfectly pitched and neatly stitched together.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Never once did she gasp for air or mop her brow.
5 <TAB> 7 <TAB> She was as cool as a cucumber.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But as you may know, things are not going well for Violetta.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> There are times when she must show a little emotion.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> She has TB, after all, and a weak-kneed lover; and though a successful courtesan, she is just about overdrawn at the bank.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Worse, her walls move all the time -- at least in this production.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Just when Ms. Gruberova sat down away from her guests to cough in private, her salon began sliding around the stage; her country hideaway also has a very active set of drapes.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Hold on to those funny braids! you wanted to caution her as the sets started to roll around once more.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This is the most moving "Traviata" I've ever seen.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Normally, Violetta can go about her business without wondering whether she is moving as gracefully as the scenery.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But this is a production designed and directed by Franco Zeffirelli and paid for by Sybil Harrington, who has no need to count her pennies, unlike Violetta, down to 20 louis at the opera's end.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Seeing all those millions in action, I was just so relieved that Ms. Gruberova, gawky thing that she is, didn't accidentally smother herself in a drape.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Large and lavish, "Traviata" is another addition to the Met's growing stock of cast-proof productions mostly by Mr. Zeffirelli.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They have a life of their own and can be counted on to look good and perform whenever a cast isn't up to either.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If a strike ever hits the Met, the company can still sell tickets to his "Boheme" and "Turandot" and boom out recordings (of another era).
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Last week's discerning audience gave a bigger hand to a greenhouse than to the tenor Neil Shicoff, who sang an aria inside it.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Inexplicably costumed as a rabbinical student, tottering around on lifts, Mr. Shicoff hardly seemed the fellow to catch a fancy cocotte's eye.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> I wish he could wear lifts in his voice.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Not nearly in his best form, the tenor made dullish sounds along with his usual clumsy hand gestures.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> Maybe Mr. Z. was too busy taming his set to work with his naturally ungainly Alfredo.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Or is it that Mr. Z. is getting a little tired of "Traviata"?
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This is the same production already seen in Paris and Florence, and its scenic ideas echo the movie he made with Placido Domingo and Teresa Stratas.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Decades earlier, Maria Callas sang the Dallas staging that introduced the flashback idea.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> In an invention that drives Verdi purists bananas, Violetta lies dying in bed during the prelude, rising deliriously when then she remembers the great parties she used to throw.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The entire opera is her dream.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Given the prelude's thematic connections with the music preceding the last act, the idea is more worn than bad, though as luck would have it, for a change there actually was a conductor in the pit whom we wanted to hear, Carlos Kleiber, trying to make memorable music while we all waited for the bed lump to stir into song.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Once she did so, the big-souled German maestro with the shaky nerves who so often cancels offered a limpid, flowing performance that in its unswagged and unswaggering approach was totally at odds with the staging.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Of heart-pounding moments there were nearly none, and whether this has to do with Mr. Kleiber or the wooden cast is hard to say.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In any event, Ms. Gruberova barely ventilated Violetta's anguish in her long meeting with Wolfgang Brendel, who as Germont seemed fairly desperate trying to inject an Italianate lilt into his heavy, teutonic baritone. "Di Provenza" wasn't much of an advertisement for sunny, southern France.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Perhaps Mr. Kleiber could let him substitute one of the songs about dead children and dark nights from Mahler's "Kindertotenlieder."
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Speaking of dark nights, the Met's next-door neighbor, the New York City Opera, has canceled its season after failing to reach a settlement with its musicians, who wanted pay parity with the the Chicago Lyric and San Francisco Opera orchestras.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Well, they can now go and audition there.
36 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Good luck.
37 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Common sense suggests that people who play for a company that charges about half what those houses do for a ticket are not in the same market.
38 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The cancellation bodes poorly for a company already beset with an identity crisis exacerbated by the retirement of general director Beverly Sills and the amazing appointment of Christopher Keene as her successor after his years of feckless toiling in the pit.
39 <TAB> -1 <TAB> As the Met discovered years ago following a belated December opening, it is nearly impossible to recapture subscribers once they have had time to ponder their entertainment choices.
40 <TAB> 46 <TAB> I, for instance, was perfectly happy at Avery Fisher Hall the other day listening to Helmuth Rilling conduct the Messa per Rossini, a strange piece written by 13 different Italian composers to honor Rossini after his death in 1868.
41 <TAB> 42 <TAB> Each of them contributed a section at the behest of Verdi, who was nearly driven to his own early grave by the troublesome arrangements.
42 <TAB> 43 <TAB> For all that, the piece landed unperformed in a dusty archive after Bologna refused to supply a chorus and orchestra.
43 <TAB> -1 <TAB> We know Verdi's own contribution was mighty impressive since the operatic "Libera me" was reworked for the Manzoni Requiem, of which he wrote every note himself having learned his lesson.
44 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The surprising discovery of the evening at Fisher was the high standard achieved by some of his now-obscure colleagues, notably Raimondo Boucheron.
45 <TAB> -1 <TAB> His melodious "Confutatis" was smoothly sung by bass Brian Matthews.
46 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Also, Teodulo Mabellini's "Lux aeterna" was intriguingly scored and splendidly put across by Mr. Rilling.

48 <TAB> -1 <TAB> She was in her most radiant, expressive voice.

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Manville, having rid itself of asbestos, now sells fiberglass, forest products, minerals and industrial goods.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Heady stuff it's not.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But Manville's ownership is unusual, and it has caught the eye of some canny -- and patient -- investors.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> The Denver-based concern, which emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings late last year, is controlled by the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> The trust, which owns 80% of Manville's stock on a fully diluted basis, is a separate legal entity that is settling claims with asbestos victims.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> When and if the trust runs out of cash -- which seems increasingly likely -- it will need to convert its Manville stock to cash.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> But as an 80% owner, if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market, it would likely depress the price of its shares.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Some investors say there is a good chance that the trust will, instead, seek to convert the company's shares to cash, in some sort of friendly restructuring that wouldn't involve just dumping stock on the market.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "Their principal asset is Manville common stock," says Jeffrey Halis, who runs Sabre Associates, an investment fund that owns Manville shares. "If they tried to sell, they'd be chasing their own tail.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> What makes the most sense is to find someone who wants to buy the whole company or cause a recapitalization of all shares."
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The trust isn't commenting on when it might need to liquefy its Manville stock.
11 <TAB> 16 <TAB> However, the trust's cash flow from investments is far short of its payments to asbestos victims.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Its cash and liquid securities fell by $338 million in the first six months of 1989.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> The trust also will receive $75 million a year starting in 1991 on a bond it holds from Manville.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> And, beginning in 1992, it will have a claim on as much as 20% of Manville's annual net income.
15 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Even so, the trust would seem to be facing a cash crunch.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> As of June 30, it had settled only about 15,000 of the 81,000 received claims from asbestos victims, for an average of $40,424 each. (The average should drop over time, since the most expensive claims are being settled first).
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And as of midyear, settled but unpaid claims amounted to $136 million -- more than half the trust's total of $268 million in cash and marketable securities. "At some point, we're going to need an infusion of funds," a person close to the trust says.
18 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Even before then, the trust may be eager to unload Manville stock.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It doesn't pay a dividend, and this trust needs income.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Moreover, with 88% of its assets tied up in Manville, the trust is badly in need of diversification. "Obviously, a diversified portfolio would have less risk," the person close to the trust says.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Manville itself doesn't rule out a restructuring.
22 <TAB> 28 <TAB> Though the ink is barely dry on its new, post-bankruptcy law structure, Bill Bullock, Manville's head of investor relations, says the company is continually pondering "whether there is a better way to be structured.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> We understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares," he says.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> Of course, one option would be for Manville to buy out the trust's shares -- which would do little to benefit public stockholders.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But the trust, in most cases, is forbidden from seeking a buyer for only its shares before November 1993.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> And both the trust and Manville are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that, in the asbestos era, tarred the Manville name.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Thus, analysts say, the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt Manville's other shareholders. "This is a rare case of a company with a big majority holder which will probably act in the interests of the minority holders," one investor says.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Even if there is no restructuring, Manville seems to be attractive long-term.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> Its stock, at 9 5/8, trades at about 8 1/2 times estimated 1989 earnings -- an appropriately low multiple for a company with recession-sensitive customers.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> Mr. Bullock says 45% of revenues are tied to construction.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Analysts predict little or no near-term growth.
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> They are, nonetheless, high on Manville's management. "It's one of the best in the business," says Salomon Brothers analyst Stephen Dobi.
33 <TAB> 36 <TAB> And he says Manville has the financial flexibility to buy other companies at
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> the best possible moment when other construction-related firms are hurting
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> and selling cheap. With a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of 1-to-1 -- and
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> $329 million in cash -- Manville is indeed actively on the prowl.
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> So far, as a price-conscious shopper, Manville hasn't bought much.
38 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Paul Kleinaitis, an analyst at Duff & Phelps, says, "Even though they have borrowing power, they have been disciplined about acquisitions." And Mr. Kleinaitis says that with 80% of its stock in friendly hands, Manville is the rare publicly traded company that can ignore short-term stock fluctuations and plan for the long haul.

0 <TAB> 2 <TAB> The Justice Department has distributed these new guidelines for U.S. Attorneys prosecuting RICO cases.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A related editorial appears today.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Under {RICO}, the government may seek a temporary restraining order (TRO) upon the filing of a RICO indictment, in order to preserve all forfeitable assets until the trial is completed and judgment entered.
3 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Such orders can have a wide-ranging impact on third parties who do business with the defendants, including clients, vendors, banks, investors, creditors, dependents, and others.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Some highly publicized cases involving RICO TROs have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press, because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process.
5 <TAB> 7 <TAB> In order to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected, the Criminal Division has instituted the following requirements to control the use of TROs in RICO prosecutions. (It should be noted that these requirements are in addition to any other existing requirements, such as review by the Asset Forfeiture Office.):
6 <TAB> 9 <TAB> 1.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> As part of the approval process for RICO prosecutions, the prosecutor must submit any proposed forfeiture TRO for review by the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section.
8 <TAB> 10 <TAB> The prosecutor must show that less-intrusive remedies (such as bonds) are not likely to preserve the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction.
9 <TAB> 11 <TAB> 2.
10 <TAB> 12 <TAB> In seeking approval of a TRO, the prosecutor must articulate any anticipated impact that forfeiture and the TRO would have on innocent third parties, balanced against the government's need to preserve the assets.
11 <TAB> 13 <TAB> 3.
12 <TAB> 14 <TAB> In deciding whether forfeiture (and, hence, a TRO) is appropriate, the Section will consider the nature and severity of the offense; the government's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant's crime.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> 4.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> When a RICO TRO is being sought, the prosecutor is required, at the earliest appropriate time, to state publicly that the government's request for a TRO, and eventual forfeiture, is made in full recognition of the rights of third parties -- that is, in requesting the TRO, the government will not seek to disrupt the normal, legitimate business activities of the defendant; will not seek through use of the relation-back doctrine to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them; will not seek to vitiate legitimate business transactions occurring between the defendant and third parties; and will, in all other respects, assist the court in ensuring that the rights of third parties are protected, through proceeding under {RICO} and otherwise.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Division expects that the prosecutor will announce these principles either at the time the indictment is returned or, at the latest, at the first proceeding before the court concerning the TRO.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> The Bush administration said it is submitting a "comprehensive" proposal for overhauling agricultural trade that could help break an impasse in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations.
1 <TAB> 3 <TAB> The proposal reiterates the U.S. desire to scrap or reduce a host of trade-distorting subsidies on farm products.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But it would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be achieved.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The U.S. plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that, together with existing tariffs, then would be phased out over 10 years.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Trade Representative Carla Hills, who along with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter unveiled the proposal, said she is confident it will gain considerable support from the U.S.'s trading partners.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Mr. Yeutter, seeking to allay European objections to an earlier U.S. plan that called for eliminating all farm-trade barriers by the year 2000, said the new U.S. proposal wouldn't "put farmers out of business" but would only encourage them to "grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants."
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The U.S. is submitting the proposal today in Geneva, hoping that the initiative will spur members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to reach agreement on new trade rules before their current negotiating round concludes in December 1990.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Another U.S. proposal filed Monday urges more "fair play" in services trade, including predictable and clear rules and equality in the treatment of foreign and domestic service companies.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Unlike the earlier U.S. farm-trade proposal which struck European countries as too extreme, the latest plan would provide some room for maneuver.
9 <TAB> 11 <TAB> For instance, the new U.S. package makes clear there would be a transition period during which GATT members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas to cushion their farmers from foreign competition.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies, as the earlier U.S. proposal did, the new package calls for the elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Less objectionable ones would be subject only to some restraints, and others with a "relatively minor trade impact" would be allowed to continue under certain conditions.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> The new U.S. plan also would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade arbitrarily.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> The goal would be to resolve disputes such as one prompted by the European Community's current attempt to bar imports of beef from hormone-treated U.S. cattle.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The U.S. contends that the rules aren't justified on health grounds.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> To encourage more competition among exporting countries, the U.S. is proposing that export subsidies, including tax incentives for exporters, be phased out in five years.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> The House approved a short-term spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> The 321-99 roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance, but the cost to the Treasury is sure to aggravate budget pressures this year and next under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> By a lopsided 401-18 margin, the chamber rejected an effort to waive Gramm-Rudman for purposes of addressing the two disasters, and budget analysts estimate the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal 1990 deficit by at least $1.44 billion unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by Congress.
3 <TAB> 10 <TAB> The budget impact will be greater still in fiscal 1991, and the issue forced a confrontation between the Appropriations Committee leadership and Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, whose California district was at the center of the earthquake last week.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Going to the well of the chamber, Mr. Panetta demanded the costs be fully counted.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> His prominent role put him in the awkward position of challenging the very committee members on whom his state will be most dependent in the months ahead.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "We do not come to this House asking for any handout," said the California Democrat. "We do not intend to hide these costs from the American people."
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> The $2.85 billion package incorporates $500 million for low-interest disaster loans, $1 billion in highway construction funds, and $1.35 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The funds are in addition to $1.1 billion appropriated last month to assist in the recovery from Hugo, bringing the total for the two disasters to nearly $4 billion in unanticipated spending.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Because of the vagaries of Gramm-Rudman, the immediate impact is relatively small.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> But the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal 1991.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Within the appropriations process, the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds to be allocated to those subcommittees that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> The underlying bill approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight, and this urgency has contributed to the speed -- and, critics say, mistakes -- that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The hastily drafted measure could hurt California by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And the state's delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate $185 million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year.
15 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Also, the high price of San Francisco real estate puts the state at odds with federal regulations more attuned to the national average.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For example, disaster loans, which will go to small businesses and homeowners, offer credit as low as 4% in some cases.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But the San Francisco delegation finds itself asking that the cap per household be lifted to $500,000 from $100,000 to assist the hard hit but often wealthy Marina district.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> The Senate is expected to make some modifications today, but both the White House and Congress appear most anxious to speed final approval before tonight's deadline.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Administration pressure discourages any effort to add to total funding, and the Senate changes are expected to be largely technical -- dealing with highway aid and lifting the ceiling on total Small Business Administration loans to $1.8 billion to accommodate the increased activity expected.
20 <TAB> 24 <TAB> Yesterday's floor action came as a House-Senate conference approved a nearly $8.5 billion fiscal 1990 military construction bill, representing a 5% reduction from last year and making severe cuts from Pentagon requests for installations abroad.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> An estimated $25.8 million is allocated to continue work in Oman.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But all funding is cut for the Philippines, and projects in South Korea are cut to $13.6 million, or less than a sixth of the administration's request.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Closer to home, the negotiators were more generous.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> An estimated $38.9 million was set aside for military installations in the home state of North Carolina Rep. W.G. Hefner, the House chairman.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> And $70.2 million would go to projects in Tennessee represented by his Senate counterpart and fellow Democrat, Sen. James Sasser.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> Texas and California are traditionally powerful within the conference, but equally striking is the dominance of Alaska, Pennsylvania and West Virginia because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process.
27 <TAB> 29 <TAB> Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) even added report language listing $49.4 million in projects he wants in the budget next year.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> No individual illustrated this mix of power more yesterday than Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii), who chairs the Senate defense subcommittee.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In the final trading, the House was insistent on setting aside $500 million to carry out base closings ordered to begin in fiscal 1990.
30 <TAB> 32 <TAB> But it gave ground to Mr. Inouye on a number of projects, ranging from a $11 million parking garage here, to a land transfer in Hawaii, to a provision to assist the Makwah Indian Tribe in Washington state.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The tribe is one of the poorest in the Pacific Northwest.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Inouye, who chairs the select committee on Indian Affairs, used his power to move $400,000 from the Air Force to the Bureau of Indian Affairs to assist in renovating a decommissoned base to accommodate a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> Meanwhile, House-Senate negotiators have tentatively agreed on a $3.18 billion anti-drug and anti-crime intitiative, cutting other federal spending 0.43% to pay for it.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A formal House-Senate conference is expected to ratify the accord later this week.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening, many Japanese had feared last week's visit from U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> They expected a new barrage of demands that Japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Instead, they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mrs. Hills' first trip to Japan as America's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> He said such results should be "measurable in dollars and cents" in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
6 <TAB> 8 <TAB> But Mrs. Hills, speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday, stressed that the objective "is not to get definitive action by spring or summer, it is rather to have a blueprint for action." She added that she expected "perhaps to have a down payment . . . some small step to convince the American people and the Japanese people that we're moving in earnest."
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> How such remarks translate into policy won't become clear for months.
8 <TAB> 13 <TAB> American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Many called it simply a contrast in styles.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Others said the Bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And some said it reflected the growing debate in Washington over pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Asked to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher's, Mrs. Hills replied: "I didn't hear every word he spoke, but as a general proposition, I think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration." Yet more than one American official who sat in with her during three days of talks with Japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly "conciliatory."
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> "I think my line has been very consistent," Mrs. Hills said at a news conference Saturday afternoon. "I am painted sometimes as ferocious, perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> I don't feel very ferocious.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> I don't feel either hard or soft.
17 <TAB> 20 <TAB> I feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade."
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> When she met the local press for the first time on Friday, Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products, satellites and supercomputers, three areas targeted under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> She highlighted exclusionary business practices that the U.S. government has identified.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> She said the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and shouldn't be tackled by setting quantitative targets.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> At her news conference for Japanese reporters, one economics journalist summed up the Japanese sense of relief. "My impression was that you would be a scary old lady," he said, drawing a few nervous chuckles from his colleagues. "But I am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity."
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mrs. Hills' remarks did raise questions, at least among some U.S. officials, about what exactly her stance is on U.S. access to the Japanese semiconductor market.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10% for years.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring U.S. companies a 20% share by 1991, but the Japanese have denied making any such promise.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> At one of her news conferences, Mrs. Hills said, "I believe we can do much better than 20%." But she stressed, "I am against managed trade.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> I will not enter into an agreement that stipulates to a percentage of the market."

5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> What far too many people concerned about education either fail to understand or choose to ignore is that American children, on the whole, are among the most undisciplined in the world, making any attempt at improvements in the mode of education potentially unsuccessful.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Unless parents and educators alike start to develop more discipline in children, all the worthy concern, discussions and actions will not solve the problem.

5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Though Dow has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals, the company still has a big stake in polyethylene, which is used in packaging and housewares.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Analysts' third-quarter estimates for the Midland, Mich., company are between $3.20 a share and $3.30 a share, compared with $3.36 a year ago, when profit was $632 million on sales of $4.15 billion.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A Dow spokeswoman declined to comment on the estimates.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> At the investment firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., the commodity-chemical segment is seen pulling down overall profit for 20 companies representative of the whole industry by 8% to 10%. "You will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better," says James Wilbur, a Smith Barney analyst.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> First Boston Corp. projects that 10 of the 15 companies it follows will report lower profit.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Most of the 10 have big commodity-chemical operations.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Still, some industry giants are expected to report continuing gains, largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals.
12 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Du Pont Co. is thought to have had steady profit growth in white pigments, fibers and polymers.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Moreover, the Wilmington, Del., company is helped when prices weaken on the commodity chemicals it buys for its own production needs, such as ethylene.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Analysts are divided over whether Du Pont will report much of a gain in the latest quarter from its Conoco Inc. oil company.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> The estimates for Du Pont range from $2.25 to $2.45 a share.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In the 1988 third quarter, the company earned $461 million, or $1.91 a share, on sales of $7.99 billion.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Du Pont declined to comment.
18 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Monsanto Co., too, is expected to continue reporting higher profit, even though its sales of crop chemicals were hurt in the latest quarter by drought in northern Europe and the western U.S.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The St. Louis-based company is expected to report again that losses in its G.D. Searle & Co. pharmaceutical business are narrowing.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Searle continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year, but Monsanto has said it expects Searle to post a profit for all of 1989.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Most estimates for Monsanto run between $1.70 and $2 a share.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A year ago, the company posted third-quarter profit of $116 million, or $1.67 a share, on sales of $2.02 billion.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Monsanto declined to comment.
24 <TAB> 26 <TAB> But the commodity-chemical producers are caught on the downside of a pricing cycle.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> By some accounts on Wall Street and in the industry, the inventory reductions are near an end, which may presage firmer demand.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> But doubters say growing production capacity could keep pressure on prices into the early 1990s.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In the latest quarter, at least, profit is expected to fall sharply.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> For Himont Inc., "how far down it is, we don't know," says Leslie Ravitz at Salomon Brothers.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The projections are in the neighborhood of 50 cents a share to 75 cents, compared with a restated $1.65 a share a year earlier, when profit was $107.8 million on sales of $435.5 million.

34 <TAB> 35 <TAB> Some analysts hedge their estimates for Quantum, because it isn't known when the company will book certain one-time charges.
35 <TAB> 36 <TAB> But the estimates range from break-even to 35 cents a share.

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Measuring cups may soon be replaced by tablespoons in the laundry room.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Procter & Gamble Co. plans to begin testing next month a superconcentrated detergent that will require only a few spoonfuls per washload.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> The move stems from lessons learned in Japan where local competitors have had phenomenal success with concentrated soapsuds.
3 <TAB> 8 <TAB> It also marks P&G's growing concern that its Japanese rivals, such as Kao Corp., may bring their superconcentrates to the U.S.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent, called Attack, which quickly won a 30% stake in the Japanese markets. "They don't want to get caught again," says one industry watcher.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Retailers in Phoenix, Ariz., say P&G's new powdered detergent -- to be called Cheer with Color Guard -- will be on shelves in that market by early November.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A P&G spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to Phoenix started late last month.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> She said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Superconcentrates aren't entirely new for P&G.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> When Attack hit the shelves in 1987, P&G's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8% from more than 20%.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> With the help of Lemon Cheer, P&G's share is now estimated to be 12%.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products, the true test for P&G will be in the $4 billion U.S. detergent market, where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The company may have chosen to market the product under the Cheer name since it's already expanded its best-selling Tide into 16 different varieties, including this year's big hit, Tide with Bleach.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> With superconcentrates, however, it isn't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more; many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine, believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> In the early 1980s, P&G tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the Ariel brand name that it markets in Europe.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But the product, which wasn't as concentrated as the new Cheer, bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> P&G and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches, but they haven't sold well, despite the convenience.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> But P&G contends the new Cheer is a unique formula that also offers an ingredient that prevents colors from fading.
19 <TAB> 21 <TAB> And retailers are expected to embrace the product, in part because it will take up less shelf space. "When shelf space was cheap, bigger was better," says Hugh Zurkuhlen, an analyst at Salomon Bros.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But with so many brands vying for space, that's no longer the case.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If the new Cheer sells well, the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Then retailers "will probably push the {less-established} brands out altogether," he says.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> Competition is bound to get tougher if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U.S.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> To be sure, Kao wouldn't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P&G, which has about 23% of the market.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Kao officials previously have said they are interested in selling detergents in the U.S., but so far the company has focused on acquisitions, such as last year's purchase of Andrew Jergens Co., a Cincinnati hand-lotion maker.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It also has a product-testing facility in California.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Some believe P&G's interest in a superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the Japanese. "This is something P&G would do with or without Kao," says Mr. Zurkuhlen.

1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> The partnership, Kaufman & Broad Land Development Venture Limited Partnership, is a 50-50 joint venture with a trust created by institutional clients of Heitman Advisory Corp., a unit of Heitman Financial Corp., a real estate advisory, management and development company with offices in Chicago and Beverly Hills, Calif.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Kaufman & Broad, a home building company, declined to identify the institutional investors.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> The land to be purchased by the joint venture hasn't yet received zoning and other approvals required for development, and part of Kaufman & Broad's job will be to obtain such approvals.
4 <TAB> 6 <TAB> The partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development, but in return, it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices, which can result in sizable savings, said Bruce Karatz, president and chief executive officer of Kaufman & Broad.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "There are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash.

1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Last year, Dentsu started HDM, a joint network with U.S. ad agency Young & Rubicam and Eurocom of France.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> A few months ago, Dentsu acquired 69% of Australian agency Fortune Communication Holdings Ltd. for 5.9 million Australian dollars (US$4.6 million).
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> Dentsu has U.S. subsidiaries, but they keep low profiles.
4 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Now, the giant marketing company, which holds 25% of Japan's 4.4 trillion yen ($30.96 billion) advertising industry, is considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the U.S. or Europe.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> What is driving Dentsu's international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its Japanese clients as they grow in the U.S. and Europe. "If we don't do something . . . we won't be able to catch up with demand," says a Dentsu spokesman. "Our president said acquisition is an effective method."
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Last year, Dentsu's foreign business accounted for less than 10% of total billings, but the company is aiming at 20% in the near future.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> So far, it appears cautious about taking the big step.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> For example, the spokesman says Dentsu has been approached by banks and securities companies a number of times to invest in the troubled British marketing group Saatchi & Saatchi PLC.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But he said Dentsu hasn't looked seriously at Saatchi.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Though Dentsu says it has no concrete acquisition plans or deadlines, it is laying the groundwork for international growth.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It is setting up a special team in charge of international markets and training workers to do business abroad.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> For the year ended March 31, Dentsu sales rose 19% to $8.9 billion from $7.5 billion, and net income jumped 59% to $102 million from $64 million.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Dentsu's billings last year were larger than those of Young & Rubicam, the world's second-largest ad agency, according to a survey by the publication Advertising Age.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> But success overseas in unfamiliar markets could be trickier than for other industries such as manufacturers.
15 <TAB> 17 <TAB> On its own, Dentsu's muscle in Japan may count for little in major foreign markets when seeking non-Japanese clients.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Thus, an acquisition may prove the necessary course.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> But Japanese agencies are cautious about expanding abroad because client relationships are different.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Japanese agencies do business with rival clients in the same industry, a practice "that would be unacceptable by traditional Western conflict rules," says Roy Warman, the London chief executive of Saatchi & Saatchi's communications division.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Although acquiring a foreign company would expand Japanese advertising agencies' business to foreign clients, many clients would also be Japanese companies expanding overseas, says the Dentsu spokesman.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But the different business system would make it hard for Dentsu to provide these Japanese companies the same kind of services they do in Japan.

4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And, for Ms. Baker, the ride was far from over.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Her bare breasts, her dancing, her voice, her beauty and, perhaps most famously, her derriere, were prominent attractions, but courage of a rare sort made her remarkable life possible.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Bricktop, another American black woman who found a measure of fame in Paris, said: "I don't think I've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life, or whose life was more complicated than Josephine's."
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Men were a constant complication.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Baker had lots of them.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But she didn't trust them and didn't reward trust.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> As she saw one key love affair, the problem wasn't her infidelity, it was his jealousy.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Her appetite for children also was large.

16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Another lifelong complication, as Phyllis Rose makes clear in "Jazz Cleopatra: Josephine Baker in Her Time" (Doubleday, 321 pages, $22.50), was racism.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Baker had the good luck to arrive in 1925 Paris, where blacks had become exotic.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> African art was in vogue and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age to be inspired by blacks.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> To be exotic was to be patronized as well as prized, but for the most part Paris was a friendly island in a racist world.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Baker had bitter experience of bigotry from her St. Louis childhood and her days in New York theater, where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line (performing of course for all-white audiences).
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Paris loved her at first sight. "She just wiggled her fanny and all the French fell in love with her," sniffed the literary world's Maria Jolas, not entirely inaccurately. "One can hardly overemphasize the importance of her rear end," Ms. Rose writes.
22 <TAB> 24 <TAB> Ms. Rose, who teaches literature at Wesleyan University, quickly proceeds to overemphasize, claiming that Baker's dancing "had uncovered a new region for desire" and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "Jazz Cleopatra" contains other, more important, false notes that undermine what is, for the most part, a lively account of a life already familiar from earlier works.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It is easy to see why Baker, a free spirit who broke many of the restraints convention places on women, attracts Ms. Rose, the author of "Parallel Lives," a wonderful study of Victorian marriage.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Still, even the title raises questions about the author's vision of her subject.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Baker's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> To find parallels, other than sexual appeal, with Cleopatra, requires an equal stretch.

29 <TAB> 33 <TAB> In fact, Ms. Baker played scenes in Casablanca that could have made it into "Casablanca."
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> During World War II, her uncomplicated view of life led her to the conclusion that the Nazis were evil and must be resisted, a decision made by only about 2% of French citizens.

36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> In her introduction, Ms. Rose writes that she feels she has much in common with Baker, but as "Jazz Cleopatra" goes on, it seems more rushed, as though the author were growing less interested.
37 <TAB> 39 <TAB> It doesn't help that sometimes Ms. Rose's language fails to deliver the effect she appears to want.
38 <TAB> -1 <TAB> One chapter opens: "World War II was not one of France's glorious moments."
39 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Elsewhere, in an attempt to explain without stating it plainly that Baker had a large gay following later in her career when she was an overdressed singer rather than underdressed dancer, Ms. Rose writes: "She was a female impersonator who happened to be a woman."

3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> GTE said net income rose 18%, aided by higher long-distance calling volumes and an increase in telephone lines in service.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Pretax operating profit from telephone operations rose 8.2% but profits from telecommunications products and electrical products were flat.
5 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Revenues rose 8.8% to $4.35 billion from $4.0 billion.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> The company said the quarter included a 10% increase in local-exchange usage for long-distance calling and a 5% increase in the number of access lines in service.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Earlier rate reductions in Texas and California reduced the quarter's revenue and operating profit $55 million; a year earlier, operating profit in telephone operations was reduced by a similar amount as a result of a provision for a reorganization.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Revenue in the telecommunications products and services unit rose 27% to $728.8 million, but operating profit was unchanged at $26.3 million, partly because of start-up expenses.

0 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Wham! Bam! Twice in two weeks the unraveling of the on-again, off-again UAL buy-out slammed the stock market.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Now, stock prices seem to be in a general retreat.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Since peaking at 2791.41 on Oct. 9, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 194.69 points, or 7%, closing Friday at 2596.72, down 17.01.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> The number of issues falling on the New York Stock Exchange each day is eclipsing the number of gainers.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And the number of stocks hitting new lows far outstrips the number setting new highs.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> But why should an iffy $6.79 billion leveraged buy-out deal shake the foundations of the entire stock market?
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Opinions vary about how important the UAL deal was to the market's health, but analysts generally agree that the market gyrations created as the UAL plan crumbled revealed a fundamental change in investor psychology.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "If this had happened a few months ago when the atmosphere was still very positive it wouldn't have been greeted with anything like the impact it has had over the past two weeks," says Dennis Jarrett, a market strategist at Kidder Peabody.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> There are, of course, analysts who view the near-panic that briefly swept through investors on Oct. 13 and again on Oct. 24 as momentary lapses of good judgment that have only temporarily undermined a healthy stock market.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Sure, price action is volatile and that's scary, but all-in-all stocks are still a good place to be, they suggest.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The reaction to the UAL debacle "is mindless," says John Connolly, chief market strategist at Dean Witter. "UAL is a small deal as far as the overall market is concerned.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> The only way you can make it a big deal is to draw linkages that just don't make sense." He suggests, for example, that investors may have assumed that just because UAL couldn't get financing, no leveraged buy-outs can get financing.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Carried even further, some investors assumed that since leveraged buy-outs are the only thing propping up stock prices, the market would collapse if no more LBOs could be done.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> "There will still be deals," argues Mr. Connolly. "There may not be as many and the buyers may not get away with some of the things they've done in the past, but deals won't disappear." He forecasts that the emphasis in mergers and acquisitions may soon return to what he calls "strategic deals, in which somebody is taking over a company not to milk the cash flow, but because it's a good fit."
14 <TAB> 17 <TAB> And even without deals, Mr. Connolly figures the market would remain healthy.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> He notes, for instance, that there hasn't been a merger or acquisition among the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1986, yet that average only three weeks ago hit a record high.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "Those stocks are up because their earnings are up and their dividends are up," he says.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Even the volatility created by stock index arbitrage and other computer-driven trading strategies isn't entirely bad, in Mr. Connolly's view.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For the long-term investor who picks stocks carefully, the price volatility can provide welcome buying opportunities as short-term players scramble frantically to sell stocks in a matter of minutes. "Who can make the better decision, the guy who has 10 seconds to decide what to do or the guy with all the time in the world?" he says. "What on earth does the UAL deal have to do with the price of Walmart, which I was able to buy on Oct. 16 at a very attractive price?"
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Kidder Peabody's Mr. Jarrett also sees some benefits to the stock market's recent drop. "We've run into a market that was beginning to run out of steam and get frothy," he says. "The balloon had been blown up so big that when somebody came along with a pin -- in this case the UAL deal -- we got a little pop."
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> The pop sobered up investors who had been getting a little too ebullient, says Mr. Jarrett. "It provided an excuse for people to get back to reality and to look at the economic data, especially the third-quarter economic numbers, and to realize that we can't continue to gloss over what is going on in the junk bond market."
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But he figures that at current levels the stock market is comfortably valued, even with the economy obviously slowing. "Just because we've got some realism back in the market doesn't mean it's going lower from here," he says. "The bottom line is that it's healthy to have this kind of sideways activity, especially after a 30% gain in stock values over the past 12 months." He's now estimating that after a period of consolidation, the Dow Jones Industrial Average will once again forge new highs.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Maybe, maybe not.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> Abby Joseph Cohen, a market strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert, isn't nearly so sanguine about the market's chances of surging to new highs anytime soon.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> Her view is that stock prices have three major props: merger and buy-out proposals, earnings and the economic outlook.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> At current levels of economic activity and earnings, stocks are fairly valued, she says.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But any chance for prices to surge above fair value lies in the speculation that accompanies a vigorous merger and buy-out business, and UAL has obviously put a damper on that. "Stocks aren't cheap anymore, there have been some judicial and legislative changes in the merger area and all of this changes the arithmetic of deals," she says. "I'm not saying they've stopped altogether, but future deals are going to be structured differently and bids probably won't be as high."
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But that's not the only problem for stocks.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The other two props -- earnings and the economic outlook -- are troubling, too. "M&A is getting all the headlines right now, but these other things have been building up more gradually," she says.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Third-quarter earnings have been generally disappointing and with economic data showing a clear slowing, the outlook for earnings in the fourth quarter and all of 1990 is getting worse.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> "There are a lot more downward than upward revisions and it looks like people are questioning corporate profits as a means of support for stock prices," she says.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> With all this, can stock prices hold their own? "The question is unanswerable at this point," she says. "It depends on what happens.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If the economy slips into a recession, then this isn't a level that's going to hold."

1 <TAB> 7 <TAB> The $409 million bid includes the assumption of an estimated $300 million in secured liabilities on those properties, according to those making the bid.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The group is led by Jay Shidler, chief executive officer of Shidler Investment Corp. in Honolulu, and A. Boyd Simpson, chief executive of the Atlanta-based Simpson Organization Inc. Mr. Shidler's company specializes in commercial real-estate investment and claims to have $1 billion in assets; Mr. Simpson is a developer and a former senior executive of L.J. Hooker.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> "The assets are good, but they require more money and management" than can be provided in L.J. Hooker's current situation, said Mr. Simpson in an interview. "Hooker's philosophy was to build and sell.

1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Unfortunately, his mother had tickets for a recital by Itzhak Perlman the same night, and she was adamant about his attending. "I threw such a fit," says Mr. McDuffie, who had begun violin studies at the age of six. "But once Perlman started playing, I didn't give a damn about basketball. . . . Afterwards, I went home and practiced for three hours."
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Today, it's obvious that the brawny, six-foot, one-inch musician made the right choice.
3 <TAB> 6 <TAB> At 31, Mr. McDuffie has a rich, full-bodied tone, an admirable rhythmic precision and an increasingly busy schedule.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He's currently in the midst of a 17-city U.S. tour with Yehudi Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia, with stops including Charleston, S.C. (Oct. 25), Sarasota, Fla. (Oct. 28), Tampa, Fla. (Oct. 29) and Miami (Oct. 31).
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Later this season he gives a recital at Washington's Kennedy Center, and appears as soloist with several major orchestras.
6 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Yet Mr. McDuffie's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> During the late 1970s, he was part of a musical "brat pack" -- a group of budding virtuosos who studied at the Juilliard School with the noted pedagogue Dorothy DeLay.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> His violin classmates included Shlomo Mintz, a protege of Isaac Stern who performed with major orchestras while still a student; Cho-Liang Lin, who joined the roster of ICM Artists Inc. at the age of 18; and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, who launched her career by winning the 1981 Naumberg Competition.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "I thought I was over the hill at 22," recalls Mr. McDuffie, an outgoing man with pale blue eyes and a light Southern drawl. "But I wasn't ready for a career at that time."
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Young McDuffie's first violin teacher was Henrik Schwarzenberger, a Hungarian refugee who taught in the Macon public school system. "He taught me how to play like a gypsy," jokes the musician. "I didn't learn to count until I got to Juilliard." After studies at that conservatory's Pre-College Division with an assistant to the legendary instructor Ivan Galamian, he switched at the college level to Miss DeLay, Mr. Galamian's longtime assistant and, ultimately, his rival. "I think I had to prove myself to her," says Mr. McDuffie. "But she was always encouraging.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> She only put her foot down twice," he continues. "In my freshman year, my roommate was known as a party animal.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> She thought I wasn't getting my practicing done." As the violinist tells it, his grandmotherly looking teacher "put her hands on her hips, stomped her foot and said, `You've just got to get the {expletive deleted} out of there. '"
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> The second incident took place after Mr. McDuffie gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself.
14 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Miss DeLay requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital. "We listened to the Chausson `Poeme, '" he recalls, "and she said, `You hear the first note, that B-flat?
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That's the only note that's truly in tune . . .'."
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "That's the most important experience I've had with any teacher," he says, "because she taught me how to listen.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Now, when I play with orchestras, the musicians often compliment me on my intonation."
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It was also at Juilliard that Mr. McDuffie discovered his predilection for conservative, 20th-century American composers such as David Diamond and Samuel Barber.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> After winning a school competition with a performance of the latter's "Violin Concerto," Mr. McDuffie was invited to play the work for the composer, who was dying of cancer.
20 <TAB> 26 <TAB> "Barber was seated by the fireplace looking very pale," recalls the violinist, who performed the work with a piano accompanist at the composer's apartment. "He didn't say much, but what he said was important because it's not in the score.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> There's a beautiful, Coplandesque motif -- he'd kill me if he heard me say that -- throughout the first movement . . . The only time the violin has it is right at the end.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It's written `marcato' in the score, and I played it that way, kind of gigue-like.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And he yelled out `dolce! dolce!' {`sweet! sweet!'}."
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "So we did it over," he adds. "I played very transparently, with the tip of the bow.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If a conductor is sensitive enough to bring down the orchestra {volume} at that point, it makes the piece magical.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> I don't know why Barber never told anybody else.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> On Isaac Stern's recording it's very biting."
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> Since leaving Juilliard, Mr. McDuffie has made some smart moves and some controversial ones.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> His guest appearance on the NBC soap opera "Another World," scandalized musical elitists.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> By contrast, he's won kudos for his espousal of William Schuman's "Violin Concerto," which he recently recorded for Angel/EMI along with Leonard Bernstein's engaging "Serenade for Violin Solo, Strings and Percussion."
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. McDuffie's sweet tone, heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal interpreter of both works.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Aided by the fluid playing of the St. Louis Symphony under Leonard Slatkin's direction, this "Serenade" really swings.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Schuman's "Violin Concerto," which sounds more like a mildly atonal rhapsody for solo violin with orchestral accompaniment, meanders until the propulsive "Agitato, fervente." But there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for soloist, brass and timpani.
34 <TAB> 36 <TAB> At Avery Fisher Hall here, Mr. McDuffie was heard recently with Mr. Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia in more conventional fare -- Bruch's overwrought "Violin Concerto in G Minor." His performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The 35-member Sinfonia played adroitly with a big, lush sound that belied its size.
36 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Whatever he plays, Mr. McDuffie finds satisfaction in the music itself -- "something greater out there than me," as he puts it during an interview at the Manhattan apartment he shares with wife, Camille, a literary publicist. "A normal person did not write the Beethoven `Violin Concerto, '" he declares. "Even when I hear it played badly, I'm still humbled by the piece.
37 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If I could ever feel I've contributed to it in some way, then all the hard work has been worth it."

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> A frozen mountaintop in Tibet may offer an important clue about whether the Earth is warming perilously.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Researchers at Ohio State University and Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Geocryology in China have analyzed samples of glacial ice in Tibet and say temperatures there have been significantly higher on average over the past half-century than in any similar period in the past 10,000 years.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> The ice samples are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the Earth has warmed considerably in recent times, largely because of pollutants in the air, and will warm far more in the century ahead.
3 <TAB> 7 <TAB> A substantial warming would melt some of the Earth's polar ice caps, raising the level of the oceans and causing widespread flooding of heavily populated coastal areas.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "If you can use data to reconstruct what happened in the past, you have much more confidence in predictions for the future," said Lonnie Thompson, a research scientist at Ohio State who dug for and analyzed the ice samples.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> To compare temperatures over the past 10,000 years, researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> These measurements can indicate temperature changes, researchers said, because the rates of evaporation of these oxygen atoms differ as temperatures change.
7 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Analysis of ice from the Dunde ice cap, a glacial plateau in Tibet 17,000 feet above sea level, show that average temperatures were higher in 1937-87 than in any other 50-year period since before the last Ice Age, Mr. Thompson said.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Some climate models project that interior regions of Asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans, which moderate temperature changes.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But the ice-core samples aren't definitive proof that the so-called greenhouse effect will lead to further substantial global heating, Mr. Thompson acknowledged.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> According to greenhouse theories, increased carbon dioxide emissions, largely caused by burning of fossil fuels, will cause the Earth to warm up because carbon dioxide prevents heat from escaping into space.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Skeptics say that if that's the case, temperatures should have risen fairly uniformly over the past century, reflecting the increase in carbon dioxide.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Instead, the Dunde ice-core record shows increasing temperatures from 1900 through the early 1950s, decreasing temperatures from the late 1950s through the mid-1970s, then higher temperatures again through last year.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Other temperature data show similar unexplained swings.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> "Climate varies drastically due to natural causes," said Mr. Thompson.

0 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Eastman Kodak Co., seeking to position itself in the potentially huge high-definition television market, unveiled a converter that can transform conventional motion-picture film into high-definition video.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The move also helps the Rochester, N.Y., photographic giant ensure that its motion-picture film business -- for which it holds a virtual monopoly, supplying every Hollywood movie company -- isn't made obsolete by the upstart HDTV business.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> While the prototype converter is costly, it's being lauded by the infant HDTV industry as a way of increasing the number of high-quality shows that can be seen on the new medium.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "The industry has been waiting with bated breath for the machines to come along," says David Niles, president of Eleven Twenty Five Productions Inc., a New York pioneer in high-definition programming.
4 <TAB> 7 <TAB> He notes that industry executives have until now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once consumers begin replacing their TV sets with HDTVs.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Japanese electronic giants, such as Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd., have focused almost entirely on HDTV hardware, and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And only a handful of small U.S. companies are engaged in high-definition software development.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> It's estimated that just about 250 hours of HD programming is currently available for airing.
8 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Kodak says its new CCD HDTV converter will help alleviate the problem by allowing programmers and broadcasters to convert movies and television programs shot in 35mm motion-picture film into high-definition video.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Consumers will be able to switch on their HDTV sets and get all the viewing benefits the high-tech medium offers.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Otherwise, they'd be watching programs that are no different in quality from what they currently view on color TVs.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It would be like "watching a black and white movie on a color TV set," says Malcolm G. Saull, chairman of the film and video department at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The new converters are "a critical link between film and the television domain," says Joerg D. Agin, vice president and general manager of Kodak's Motion Picture and Audiovisual Products division.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Kodak won't disclose the cost or when its converter will be on the market, but it's estimated the machine may be available within two years.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A similar machine already on the market, made by Rank Sintel Ltd., a unit of Rank Organisation, costs about $500,000.
15 <TAB> 22 <TAB> And the potential market is tremendous, industry experts say.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> If HDTV takes off in the U.S., there will be demand for some 4,000 to 5,000 HDTV converters, known in the industry as telecines.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "The converter is head and shoulders above anything else I've seen," says Richard J. Stumpf, vice president-engineering and development at MCA Inc. 's Universal City Studios.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And Mr. Niles, the program producer, contends that Kodak's move is "a sound marketing decision.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They can't afford to stay out of HDTV."
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Indeed, the stakes are high.
22 <TAB> 25 <TAB> The U.S. electronics industry estimates that the HDTV market will total about $150 billion over the next two decades, with an additional $400 billion expected to go for related products.

24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And the sets are wider, resembling the dimensions of a movie screen.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> But the financial rewards aren't expected soon, nor are they guaranteed.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> Experts estimate the first sets of HDTVs won't be available for another five to 10 years, and will probably retail for more than $3,000 each in today's dollars.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Some critics say they won't be quickly embraced by consumers because of the high price.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Nevertheless, Kodak couldn't risk letting HDTV turn its motion-picture film business into a dinosaur. "Kodak understands HDTV is where everybody is going," says RIT's Mr. Spaull.

5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Last year, 43 million tons of desert were moved from one dune to another to recover 934,242 carats, which comes to 46 tons of sand per carat, or one-fifth gram.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Oh yes, the Atlantic was also pushed back 300 yards.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "If there's diamonds out there, we'll get to them," says Les Johns, De Beers's engineering manager.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Here, wedged between shifting dunes and pounding waves at the world's most inhospitable diamond dig, lies the earth's most precious jewel box.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Thanks to centuries of polishing by Mother Nature -- first in the gentle current of the Orange River that carried the stones from South Africa's interior, then in the cold surf of the ocean, and finally in the coarse sands of the desert -- 98% of the diamonds uncovered are of gem quality.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> While other mines might yield more carats, a higher percentage of them go to industrial use.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Since this treasure chest is too big to fit in a bank vault, it has been turned into one.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Months after railway worker Zacharias Lewala first picked up a diamond from the sand in 1908, the German colonialists who controlled Namibia proclaimed a wide swath of the desert -- about 200 miles north from the Orange River and 60 miles inland from the Atlantic -- a restricted area, a designation normally reserved for military operations.

1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> MORGAN STANLEY, THE ONCE STODGY investment house, in 1974 helped a corporate client complete a hostile takeover.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It was the start of a boom in unfriendly, even ungentlemanly, mergers.
3 <TAB> 5 <TAB> On July 18, 1974, International Nickle of Canada -- advised by Morgan -- offered $28 a share, equal to $157 million, for ESB, a Philadelphia battery maker.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> ESB said it was given only a three-hour advance warning on a "take it or leave it" basis from Inco, as the Toronto company is called.
5 <TAB> 7 <TAB> "ESB is aware that a hostile tender offer is being made by a foreign company for all of ESB's shares," said F.J. Port, ESB's president. "Hostile" thus entered the merger-acquisition lexicon.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Joseph Flom, of Skadden, Arps, Slote, Meagher & Flom, which became a leading legal firm in merger cases, said the case "made takeovers respectable."
7 <TAB> 9 <TAB> ESB spurned Inco and within five days ESB had a "white knight" as United Aircraft -- headed by Harry Gray, a shrewdly friendly acquirer of companies -- offered $34 a share.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Gray was advised by Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> ESB directors warmly accepted, but a whirlwind bidding match ensued.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Pension funds, insurers and other behemoths of the investing world said they began scooping up stocks during Friday's market rout.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And they plan to buy more today.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Rightly or wrongly, many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the October 1987 crash: Buying at the bottom pays off.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> To be sure, big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> They could still panic and bail out of the market.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But their 1987 performance indicates that they won't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> "Last time, we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst," said John W. Rogers, president of Chicago-based Ariel Capital Management Inc., which manages $1.1 billion of stocks.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Rogers spent half his cash on hand Friday for "our favorite stocks that have fallen apart." He expects to invest the rest if the market weakens further.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Denver-based portfolio manager James Craig wasn't daunted when Friday's rout shaved $40 million from the value of the $752 million Janus Fund he oversees. "I waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through," he said.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Then he jumped into the market: "I spent $30 million in the last half-hour."
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Other money managers also opened their wallets. "I was buying at the close (Friday) and I'll be buying again because I know we're getting good value," said Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management Inc., Greenwich, Conn. "There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash."
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Unlike mutual funds, which can be forced to sell stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money, big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Most often, they do just that, because stocks have proved to be the best-performing long-term investment, attracting about $1 trillion from pension funds alone.
13 <TAB> 15 <TAB> "If you bought after the crash, you did very very well off the bottom," said Stephen B. Timbers, chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The $56 billion California Public Employees Retirement System, for one, added $1 billion to its stock portfolio two years ago.
15 <TAB> 20 <TAB> "The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders, and that they can't react to short-term events, good or bad," said Stephen L. Nesbitt, senior vice president for the pension consultants Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica, Calif. "Those that pulled out (of stocks) regretted it," he said, "so I doubt you'll see any significant changes" in institutional portfolios as a result of Friday's decline.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Stocks, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, have been stellar performers this year, rising 27.97% before Friday's plunge, excluding dividends.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Even Friday's slump leaves investors ahead more than 20%, well above the annual average for stocks over several decades.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> "You could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market," said James D. Awad, president of New York-based BMI Capital Corp.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Awad, however, worries that the market "could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days.
20 <TAB> 23 <TAB> It can happen before you can turn around." He said he discerns many parallels with 1987, including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading. "The only thing you don't have," he said, "is the `portfolio insurance' phenomenon overlaid on the rest."
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique, which is widely thought to have worsened the 1987 crash.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Not really insurance, this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of S&P futures contracts.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> In its severest test, the $60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash didn't work, as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Even without portfolio insurance, market conditions were grim Friday, money managers said.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Neil Weisman, whose New York-based Chilmark Capital Partners had converted 85% of its $220 million investment pool to cash in recent months, said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "We got calls from big block houses asking us if we want to make bids on anything," said Mr. Weisman, who, happy with his returns on investments chalked up earlier, declined the offers.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Weisman predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again, trapping more investors. "I think it will be a rigor mortis rally," he said.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Meanwhile, Friday brought a reprieve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Especially gleeful were the short sellers, who have been pounded by this year's market climb.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The shorts sell borrowed shares, hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The nation's largest short-selling operation is Feshbach Brothers, Palo Alto, Calif., which said last May that its short positions had shown losses of 10% for the year up to that point.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> All that now has changed. "We're ahead for the year because of Friday," said the firm's Kurt Feshbach. "We're not making a killing, but we had a good day."

1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> SMYRNA, Ga. -- The auto-dealer strip in this booming suburb runs nearly five miles along Cobb Parkway, stretching from the Perimeter highway that circles Atlanta to the "Big Chicken," a pullet-roofed fast-food restaurant and local landmark.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Twenty years ago, in the infancy of suburban sprawl, just a handful of dealerships were here.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> Now there are 23.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Alongside such long-familiar names as Chevrolet, Ford and Dodge are nameplates that didn't exist until three years ago: Acura, Sterling, Hyundai.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Under construction is the strip's 24th showroom, the future home of Lexus, a luxury marque launched by Toyota Motor Corp. just two months ago.
6 <TAB> 8 <TAB> The 1980s have spawned an explosion of consumer choice in America, in everything from phone companies to colas.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And especially, as the Cobb Parkway strip attests, in cars.
8 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Americans now can choose among 572 different models of cars, vans and trucks, up from just 408 when the decade began, according to Automotive News, a trade publication.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For car marketers, it has become a much tougher battle to keep loyal customers from defecting to one of the new makes on the block.
10 <TAB> 14 <TAB> For American car buyers, the proliferation of choice is both liberating and confusing.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Malcolm MacDougall, vice chairman of the Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor advertising agency in New York, calls the proliferation "nameplate mania." He says the number of automobile choices is causing stress among consumers today, and that people will simply ignore new models that lack a well-defined image. "The winners," he predicts, "will be brands from car makers that have traditionally been associated with quality and value."
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> He says it's important for a new make to be as distinctive as possible while still retaining links to the parent company's quality image.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He applauds Toyota and Nissan Motor Co. for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models, rather than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car lines.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Some auto executives believe the benefits of more choice outweigh the drawbacks. "There's more noise out there, and the consumer may have to work harder to cut through it," says Vincent P. Barabba, executive director of market research and planning at General Motors Corp. "But the reward is that there's less need to make tradeoffs" in choosing one's wheels.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Jeanene Page, of North Salt Lake City, Utah, likes the broader selection.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> She wants something big, and already has looked at the Chrysler New Yorker and Lincoln Town Car.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Now, the 55-year-old car shopper is zeroing in on a full-sized van, figuring that it's just the thing to haul nine grandchildren and pull a boat at the same time. "That seems to be what all my friends are using to take the grandkids to the lake," she says.
18 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Market segmentation in cars isn't new, but it's far more extensive than when Alfred P. Sloan Jr. conceived the idea 50 years ago.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> The legendary GM chairman declared that his company would make "a car for every purse and purpose."
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Now there are many cars for every purse and purpose.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Just four years ago, GM planners divided the combined car and truck market into seven segments.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Today, they identify 19 distinct segments for cars, and another 11 for trucks and vans.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> The number of makes has mushroomed because the U.S. is the world's biggest and richest market for automobiles; virtually every auto maker wants to sell here.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For every brand like Renault or Fiat that has been squeezed out, others such as Isuzu, Daihatsu and Mitsubishi have come in.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Detroit tries to counter the foreign invasion with new brands of its own.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> GM launched the Geo marque this year to sell cars made in partnership with foreign auto makers, and next year GM's long-awaited Saturn cars will make their debut.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> Ford Motor Co. created the Merkur nameplate in 1985 to sell its German-made touring sedans in the U.S.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But slow sales forced Ford to kill the brand just last week.
29 <TAB> 44 <TAB> When consumers have so many choices, brand loyalty is much harder to maintain.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> The Wall Street Journal's "American Way of Buying" survey found that 53% of today's car buyers tend to switch brands.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For the survey, Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization each asked about 2,000 U.S. consumers about their buying habits.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Which cars do Americans favor most these days?
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> It's hard to generalize, but age seems to be the best predictor.
34 <TAB> 35 <TAB> Adults under age 30 like sports cars, luxury cars, convertibles and imports far more than their elders do.
35 <TAB> 36 <TAB> Three of every 10 buyers under 30 would prefer to buy a sports car, compared with just 16% of adults 30 and over, according to the Journal survey.
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> Young consumers prefer luxury cars by a 37% to 28% margin -- even though older buyers, because of their incomes, are more likely to actually purchase a luxury car.
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> Perhaps most striking, 35% of households headed by people aged 18 to 44 have at least one foreign car.
38 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That's true of only 14% of households headed by someone 60 or older.
39 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Generally, imports appeal most to Americans who live in the West and are well-educated, affluent and, especially, young. "For many baby boomers, buying a domestic car is a totally foreign experience," says Christopher Cedergren, auto-market analyst with J.D. Power & Co. of Agoura Hills, Calif.
40 <TAB> 41 <TAB> Such preferences persist even though many Americans believe differences between imported and domestic cars are diminishing.
41 <TAB> 42 <TAB> Only 58% of Americans now believe that foreign cars get better gas mileage than domestic models, the Journal survey found, down from 68% in 1987.
42 <TAB> 43 <TAB> Some 46% give foreign cars higher quality ratings, down from 50% two years ago.
43 <TAB> -1 <TAB> On the other hand, only 42% say foreign cars are less comfortable than U.S. models, down from 55% in 1987.
44 <TAB> -1 <TAB> People in the automotive business disagree over how susceptible younger Americans are to brand switching. "Once buying habits are formed, they're very hard to break," declares Thomas Mignanelli, executive vice president for Nissan's U.S. sales operations.
45 <TAB> 47 <TAB> But out on Cobb Parkway, Ted Negas sees it differently. "The competition is so intense that an owner's loyalty to a dealership or a car is virtually nonexistent," says Mr. Negas, vice president of Ed Voyles Oldsmobile, one of the first dealerships to locate on the strip.
46 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Thus the very fickleness of baby boomers may make it possible to win them back, just as it was possible to lose them.
47 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The battle for customer loyalty is evident along the Cobb Parkway strip.
48 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Ed Voyles Olds recently established a special section in the service department for owners whose cars are less than a year old, so they get quicker service.
49 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Just down the street, Chris Volvo invites serious shoppers to test-drive a new Volvo to any other dealership along the strip, and compare the cars side-by-side.
50 <TAB> 51 <TAB> Manufacturers, too, are stretching further to lure buyers.
51 <TAB> -1 <TAB> GM's Cadillac division, ignoring Detroit's long-held maxim that safety doesn't sell, is airing television commercials touting its cars' safety features.
52 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Cadillac may be on to something.
53 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Some 60% of the survey respondents said they would buy anti-lock brakes even if they carry a medium or high price tag.
54 <TAB> -1 <TAB> More than 50% felt the same way about air bags.
55 <TAB> 56 <TAB> Both features appealed most to buyers under 45.
56 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In contrast, dashboard computers, power seats and turbo-charged engines had little appeal.
57 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But even a little appeal has a lot of attraction these days.
58 <TAB> -1 <TAB> GM's Pontiac division is offering a turbo-charged V-6 engine on its Grand Prix model, even though it expects to sell only about 4,000 cars equipped with that option.
59 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The reason: Items with narrow appeal can be important in a market as fragmented as today's.
60 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Americans spent more than $190 billion on new cars and trucks last year, and just 1% of that market exceeded Polaroid Co. 's sales of $1.86 billion. "Even if it's only 1%," says GM's Mr. Barabba, "would you throw away sales the size of Polaroid?"

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> China could exhaust its foreign-exchange reserves as early as next year, a Western government report says, unless imports are cut drastically to help narrow the balance-of-payments deficit.
1 <TAB> 3 <TAB> According to the report, completed last month, if China's trade gap continues to widen at the pace seen in the first seven months of this year, the reserves would be wiped out either in 1990 or 1991.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A country is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover three months of its imports.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The $14 billion of reserves China had in June would cover just that much.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The report by the Western government, which declines to be identified, concludes that "a near-term foreign-exchange payment problem can be avoided only if import growth drops to below 5% per annum."
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> According to Chinese customs figures, import growth has slowed in recent months, dropping to 16% in July and 7.1% in August from the year-earlier periods, compared with an average growth rate of 26% in the first half.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> But before import growth slowed, China's buying spree in the first half already had taken its toll on foreign-exchange reserves.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> The $14 billion level in June marked a drop from $19 billion at the end of April.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> China's last big import binge sent reserves tumbling to $10.6 billion in June 1985 from $16.6 billion the previous September.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> China might stave off a crisis if it acts as forcefully as it did to arrest the 1985 decline, when Beijing slammed the brakes on foreign-exchange spending and devalued the currency.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But this time, China faces a more difficult battle because of economic forces that have come into play since the Tiananmen Square killings June 4.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> For example, China's hard-currency income is expected to suffer from the big drop in tourist arrivals since June 4.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Revenue from tourism this year is projected to total $1.3 billion, down from $2.2 billion last year.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Because of this and the huge trade gap, the deficit in China's current account, which measures trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers of funds, is expected to widen sharply from the $3.8 billion deficit last year.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> The Western government report suggests a number of scenarios for China's current-account balance, two of which are considered most likely.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> In one, imports and exports continue to grow at the respective average rates of 25% and 5% recorded during the first seven months, and the current-account deficit widens to $13.1 billion.
16 <TAB> 18 <TAB> In 1985, China had a record deficit of $11.4 billion.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The other scenario assumes that Beijing takes effective actions to curb imports in the coming months.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> In this case, China would still finish the year with a current-account deficit of $8.7 billion, based on projections that imports for all of this year grow 20% and exports 10%.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If China were still on good terms with foreign lenders, it might be able to stem the drain on its foreign-exchange reserves by using some loan funds to offset the current-account deficit.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> But since June, foreign bankers led by international financial institutions have virtually suspended their new loans to China.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Even if borrowing resumes, commercial bankers aren't expected to lend as much as before.
22 <TAB> 24 <TAB> In addition, economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments as businessmen become increasingly wary of China's deteriorating political and economic environment.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> On top of all this, foreign-debt repayments are expected to peak in 1991 to 1992.

1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> The average yield on six-month CDs of $50,000 and less slipped to 7.96% from 8.00%, according to Banxquote Money Markets, an information service based here.
2 <TAB> 4 <TAB> On one-year CDs of $50,000 and less, the average slid to 8.02% from 8.06%.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Both issues are among the most popular with individual investors.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> "Because of shrinkage in the economy, rates can be expected to decline over a one-year horizon," said Norberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote. "It's unclear how much rates can fall and how soon."
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Changes in CD yields in the week ended Tuesday were in line with blips up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Interest rates generally began declining last spring after moving steadily upward for more than a year.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> The average yield on small-denomination three-month CDs moved up two-hundredths of a percentage point in the latest week to 7.85%.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Long-term CDs declined just a fraction.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> The average yield on both two-year CDs and five-year CDs was 7.98%.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Only CDs sold by major brokerage firms posted significant increases in average yields in the latest week, reflecting increased yields on Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The average yield on six-month broker-sold CDs rose to 8.29% from 8.05% and on one-year CDs the average yield rose to 8.30% from 8.09%.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The brokerage firms, which negotiate rates with the banks and thrifts whose CDs they sell, generally feel they have to offer clients more than they can get on T-bills or from banks and thrifts directly.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> T-bills sold at Monday's auction yielded 7.90% for six months and 7.77% for three months, up from 7.82% and 7.61%, respectively, the week before.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> So-called jumbo CDs, typically in denominations of $90,000 and up, also usually follow T-bills and interest rate trends in general more than those aimed at small investors.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Some jumbos posted fractional changes in average yields this week, both up and down.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> The average yield on threemonth jumbos rose to 8.00% from 7.96%, while the two-year average fell by the same amount to 7.89%.
17 <TAB> 19 <TAB> Six-month and oneyear yields were unchanged, on average.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "The (CD) market is unsettled right now," said Banxquote's Mr. Mehl. "It's very easily influenced by changes in the stock market and the junk bond market."
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The small changes in averages reflect generally unchanged yields at many major banks.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Some, however, lowered yields significantly.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> At Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, for example, the yield on a small denomination six-month CD fell about a quarter of a percentage point to 8.06%.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> CenTrust Savings Bank said federal thrift regulators ordered it to suspend dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock, indicating that regulators' concerns about the troubled institution have heightened.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> In a statement, Miami-based CenTrust said the regulators cited the thrift's operating losses and "apparent losses" in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Regulators also ordered CenTrust to stop buying back the preferred stock.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> David L. Paul, chairman and chief executive officer, criticized the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, which issued the directive, saying it was "inappropriate" and based on "insufficient" reasons.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He said the thrift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step that signals that regulators have deep concerns about an institution's health.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> In March, regulators labeled CenTrust a "troubled institution," largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In the same month, the Office of Thrift Supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track.
8 <TAB> 10 <TAB> For the nine months ended June 30, CenTrust had a net loss of $21.3 million, compared with year-earlier net income of $52.8 million.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> CenTrust, which is Florida's largest thrift, holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Since April, it has pared its high-yield bond holdings to about $890 million from $1.35 billion.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Mr. Paul said only about $150 million of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> The remainder, he said, are commercial loan participations, or private placements, that aren't filed with the SEC and don't have a ready market.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> CenTrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market valuations for the junk bonds.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> The Office of Thrift Supervision has been hounding CenTrust to provide current market values for its holdings, but CenTrust has said it can't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Regulators have become increasingly antsy about CenTrust's and other thrifts' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market.
16 <TAB> 18 <TAB> The legislation requires thrifts to divest themselves of junk bonds in the new, somber regulatory climate.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, CenTrust common shares closed at $3, down 12.5 cents.
18 <TAB> 20 <TAB> In a statement Friday, Mr. Paul challenged the regulators' decision, saying the thrift's operating losses and "apparent" junk-bond losses "have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank." He also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In the third quarter, for instance, CenTrust added $22.5 million to its general reserves.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Mr. Paul said the regulators should instead move ahead with approving CenTrust's request to sell 63 of its 71 branches to Great Western Bank, a unit of Great Western Financial Corp. based in Beverly Hills, Calif.
21 <TAB> 25 <TAB> The branch sale is the centerpiece of CenTrust's strategy to transform itself into a traditional S&L from a high-flying institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits, according to Mr. Paul.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> Most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction, which was announced in July, long before now.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> CenTrust, however, touts the branch sale, saying it would bring in $150 million and reduce the thrift's assets to $6.7 billion from $9 billion.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> It said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $82 million, or about 1.2% of assets, from a negative $33 million as of Sept. 30, thus bringing CenTrust close to regulatory standards.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> CenTrust said the branch sale would also reduce the company's large amount of good will by about $180 million.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Critics, however, say the branch sale will make CenTrust more dependent than ever on brokered deposits and junk bonds.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Paul counters that he intends to further pare the size of CenTrust by not renewing more than $1 billion of brokered certificates of deposit when they come due.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The thrift is also working to unload its junk-bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds, and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate, as required under the new thrift law.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> CHICAGO - Sears, Roebuck & Co. is struggling as it enters the critical Christmas season.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Yesterday, the retailing and financial services giant reported a 16% drop in third-quarter earnings to $257.5 million, or 75 cents a share, from a restated $305 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> But the news was even worse for Sears's core U.S. retailing operation, the largest in the nation.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Sears said its U.S. stores had a loss of $6.9 million, their first deficit for the period in more than five years.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Analysts estimated that sales at U.S. stores declined in the quarter, too.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> The results underscore Sears's difficulties in implementing the "everyday low pricing" strategy that it adopted in March as part of a broad attempt to revive its retailing business.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Under the new approach, Sears set prices that were somewhere between its old "regular" and "sale" prices.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> The company said it would resort far less often to slashing prices to woo shoppers.
8 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Sears officials insist they don't intend to abandon the everyday pricing approach in the face of the poor results.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Instead, a spokesman blames the dismal third-quarter showing on "an environment that is being distorted by a very harsh climate for sales of durable goods," which account for roughly two-thirds of Sears's annual merchandise volume.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> The new pricing strategy "is working," the spokesman asserted.
11 <TAB> 13 <TAB> He added that, after an initial surge triggered by an advertising blitz in March, Sears expected that the pricing program wouldn't have any effect on revenue.
12 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Sears has been counting on growth coming from the large displays of brand-name merchandise it is adding to its stores over the next two years in what it calls "power formats."
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But analysts say Sears faces an especially daunting challenge on the eve of the Christmas shopping season. "I believe everyday pricing in the current environment doesn't work," says Walter Loeb of Morgan Stanley & Co., pointing to soft durable-goods sales. "Sears is likely to be unsuccessful if it continues with its pricing policy when everyone else is offering unusual values."
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In what amounts to an admission that the transition hasn't gone as smoothly as Sears had hoped, the giant retailer is now trying new ways to drum up business without appearing to abandon its seven-month-old strategy.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> The company is highlighting more special deals in its advertising and stores, and it's offering to defer finance charges on certain big-ticket items.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Sears is also stepping up its television ads and changing its message.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> In a new TV ad, for instance, a woman going through the Sunday newspaper brands as hype claims by other stores that they are offering goods for "50%, 60% and 70% off." By lowering prices throughout its stores, she says, "Sears has the right idea."
18 <TAB> 24 <TAB> But the ad also mentions Sears's sales -- a topic that the retailer has avoided since switching to everyday pricing. "When Sears has a sale at a special price," the woman in the ad declares, "it's something you don't want to miss."
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Recent surveys by Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a market research firm in Chicago, suggest that Sears is having a tough time attracting shoppers because it hasn't yet done enough to improve service or its selection of merchandise.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> The number of people who said they were more likely to shop at Sears fell in September to 37% from 66% in March, when Sears blanketed the airwaves with ads about its new pricing strategy.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Moreover, the number of people who spontaneously cited lower prices as the reason for their interest in Sears declined to 16% in September from 33% in March.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> Just 5% of the respondents mentioned brands in September, up slightly from 2% in March.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Only 2% of the people in September cited Sears's "friendly personnel."
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "The power of price as an appeal, which was very considerable in driving traffic in March and April, has diminished," says George Rosenbaum, president of Shapiro & Associates. "You see some improvement in these other areas, but it's a very small and slow process."
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> For the third quarter, Sears said its total revenue rose 4.8% to $13.18 billion from $12.57 billion a year earlier.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> Net income at Sears's merchandise group, which includes international and credit card operations, as well as U.S. stores, fell 25%.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> Profit at Sears's Allstate insurance unit fell 38% to $126.1 million because of Hurricane Hugo, which inflicted the greatest single storm damage loss in the company's history.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> Sears said claims from the storm, as expected, reduced its third-quarter net by $80 million, or 23 cents a share.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> Allstate is expected to absorb another big hit in the fourth quarter as claims pour in from the San Francisco earthquake.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> But a spokesman said the quake won't have as big a financial impact on Allstate as Hurricane Hugo did.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> Net income at Sears's Dean Witter Financials Services group, meanwhile, rose nearly 32% to $35.7 million, reflecting improvements in its basic stock brokerage and Discover credit card businesses.
32 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Profit at Sears's Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group nearly quadrupled to $81.2 million because of gains on sales of property.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Sears shares closed at $40.50, up 87.5 cents.

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Retailers in the West and parts of the South are entering the critical Christmas shopping season with more momentum than those in other regions.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> In a new report, the International Council of Shopping Centers said sales of general merchandise in the West for the first seven months of 1989 rose 6.6% above year-earlier levels.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Sales increased a more modest 4.8% in the South and 4.4% in the Midwest.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> But sales in the oil-patch state of Texas surged 12.9% and sales in South Carolina jumped 10.6% in the period, the New York trade group said.
4 <TAB> 6 <TAB> In the Northeast, however, sales declined 0.4% in the period, with sales in New England falling 2.6%.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The numbers show that "we don't have a monolithic economy," said Isaac Lagnado, council research director. "There are a lot of have and have-not markets."
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Sales nationally rose 3.9% through July, the latest month for which the figures are available, the council said.
7 <TAB> 18 <TAB> The Northern California earthquake and Hurricane Hugo are likely to temporarily damp sales growth in the West and South Carolina.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> But Mr. Lagnado predicted the regional trends would continue through Christmas. "The big mo is as much of a factor in retailing as in politics," he said.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Christmas quarter is important to retailers because it represents roughly a third of their sales and nearly half of their profits.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> The council's report is based on data the trade group buys from the U.S. Census Bureau.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> The information on 125 metropolitan markets is supplied by retailers such as Sears, Roebuck & Co. and K mart Corp. as well as closely held concerns such as R.H. Macy & Co.
12 <TAB> 17 <TAB> The council plans to release its regional reports monthly.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Mr. Lagnado said strength in employment appears to have the biggest impact on sales growth.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> El Paso, Austin and Fort Worth, the three strongest retail markets in the nation, are all located in Texas, where employment grew a relatively strong 2%.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Massachusetts, which has lost jobs in the computer and defense-related industries, was the weakest link in bleak New England.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The results reflect a reversal in the fortunes of the regions during the past two years.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In 1987, the West had the slowest sales growth, and the South and the Midwest were first and second respectively, according to the council.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> Mr. Lagnado said that although retailers probably won't ever recover sales lost because of the California quake and Hurricane Hugo, they could see some benefits later on.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Stores such as Sears that sell big-ticket durable goods might actually get a boost as consumers rush to replace items lost in the disasters, he said.

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The House Appropriations Committee approved an estimated $2.85 billion in emergency funding to assist California's recovery from last week's earthquake and to extend further aid to East Coast victims of Hurricane Hugo.
1 <TAB> 4 <TAB> The package was termed excessive by the Bush administration, but it also provoked a struggle with influential California lawmakers who sought unsuccessfully to add nearly $1 billion more and waive current restrictions to expedite the distribution of funds.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> By a 26-7 margin, the committee scuttled the more expensive alternative, and the debate forced a strained confrontation between Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten (D., Miss.) and his party's largest state delegation in the House.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "I have no regrets about going forward," said Rep. Vic Fazio (D.,Calif.), who sought later to play down the sometimes hostile tone of the long evening meeting. "We are the Golden State," Mr. Fazio said, "and there is a certain amount of jealousy."
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> The $2.85 billion package incorporates $500 million for small-business loans, $1 billion in highway construction funds, and $1.35 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> The funding is attached to a stopgap bill to keep most of the government operating through Nov. 15.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The measure is expected to come before the House today, and Congress is under pressure to complete action before midnight EDT tomorrow, when the current continuing resolution expires.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Given California's size and political importance, the White House is eager to appear generous.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> But in private meetings yesterday, Budget Director Richard Darman argued that only $1.5 billion in new federal appropriations are needed to supplement existing resources.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A White House budget office analysis estimates that $500 million -- or half the level in the committee bill -- is needed for highway assistance to meet California's needs, and the administration rejects the notion that new appropriations are needed to finance disaster loans by the Small Business Administration.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "Everybody appreciates that it is a national disaster and that we've got to address it," said Mr. Darman, who came to the Capitol to meet with Mr. Whitten and California lawmakers before the committee session. "I would hope very much that we wouldn't end up in a kind of situation where you have a bidding war and then a veto threat."
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Although this White House pressure was clearly a factor among committee Republicans, no single influence was greater than Mr. Whitten.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> A master of pork-barrel politics, he had crafted the $2.85 billion package in vintage style and used the full force of his chairmanship to keep the proposal intact and dismiss any alternative.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> When Mr. Fazio offered the California-backed $3.84 billion plan, Mr. Whitten insisted that the full 14 pages be read aloud by the panel's clerk to underscore the range of legislative changes also sought by the delegation.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> On the chairman's motion, the California package was subsequently reduced to less-binding report language, and even when this was accepted as such on a voice vote, Mr. Whitten pointedly opposed it.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> More important than money in many cases are waivers California is seeking on current restrictions covering federal highway funds, such as a $100 million cap on how much any single state can receive in emergency funds in a year.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Whitten's package appears to accomplish this purpose, but the state faces more resistance in its bid for an extended waiver on having to put up any matching funds on repairs completed in the next six months.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A member in the House leadership and skilled legislator, Mr. Fazio nonetheless found himself burdened not only by California's needs but by Hurricane Hugo amendments he accepted in a vain effort to build support in the panel.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The California Democrat appeared embarrassed by provisions inserted on behalf of owners of private beaches in the Virgin Islands, and lumber interests sought to add another $100 million in federal aid to plant timber on private land in North and South Carolina.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> California's high-priced real estate puts it in an awkward position, too.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> One provision last night would have raised the cap on disaster loans to $500,000 from $100,000 per household to accommodate San Francisco losses.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Claude Bebear, chairman and chief executive officer, of Axa-Midi Assurances, pledged to retain employees and management of Farmers Group Inc., including Leo E. Denlea Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, if Axa succeeds in acquiring Farmers.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Mr. Bebear added that the French insurer would keep Farmers' headquarters in Los Angeles and "will not send French people to run the company." Axa would also maintain Farmers' relationships with the insurance exchanges that it manages.
2 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Mr. Bebear made his remarks at a breakfast meeting with reporters here yesterday as part of a tour in which he is trying to rally support in the U.S. for the proposed acquisition.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The bid is part of Sir James Goldsmith's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC, the British tobacco, retailing, paper and financial-services giant that acquired Farmers last year for $5.2 billion.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Axa has agreed to acquire Farmers from Sir James's investment vehicle, Hoylake Investments Ltd., for $4.5 billion plus a $1 billion investment in Hoylake.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Any acquisition of Farmers needs the approval of insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers operates, and Mr. Bebear's trip will take him to Idaho, Arizona and New York after his stay here; he will meet with insurance regulators, legislators, industry excutives and the press.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Hearings on Axa's acquisition application have been set for Nov. 13 in Idaho; Nov. 20 in Illinois; Nov. 24 and Dec. 4 in Arizona; Dec. 11 in Washington state; and Jan. 8 in Oregon.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Hearings haven't yet been set in Texas, Ohio and Kansas.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> California's insurance commissioner doesn't hold hearings on acquisition applications.
9 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Although Axa has been rebuffed by Farmers and hasn't had any meetings with management, Mr. Bebear nonetheless appears to be trying to woo the company's executives with promises of autonomy and new-found authority under Axa.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He said Mr. Denlea would be a member of the top management team of the Axa-Midi group of companies, and would "help define policies and strategies of the group."
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Farmers was quick yesterday to point out the many negative aspects it sees in having Axa as its parent.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> For one, Axa plans to do away with certain tax credits that have resulted in more than $600 million paid to the Farmers exchanges during the past few years to offset underwriting losses.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Those credits result because of taxes that Farmers, as the management company, has paid, and have "proved to be very important for the exchanges," a Farmers spokesman said.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Bebear contended that the tax cost to the exchanges under the revised structure would be about $8 million a year, which he described as "peanuts."

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> The Justice Department scrambled to play down the significance of its new guidelines concerning prosecutions under the federal racketeering law.
1 <TAB> 3 <TAB> The guidelines were distributed to U.S. attorneys last summer but were disclosed for the first time by press reports this week.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They discourage prosecutors, under certain circumstances, from seeking court orders seizing the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial.
3 <TAB> 6 <TAB> But David Runkel, chief Justice Department spokesman, said the guidelines "are a codification and a clarification far more than a new direction."
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law against white-collar defendants, as opposed to alleged organized-crime figures, has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Critics have complained that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury determines they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> In the new guidelines, the Justice Department says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial, "the government will not seek to disrupt the normal, legitimate business activities of the defendant" and "will not seek. . .to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them."
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The guidelines also state, "The government's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant's crime."
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Another provision clarifies certain limits on when prosecutors may use tax-fraud charges as a basis for bringing a racketeering case.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Mr. Runkel declined to speculate on whether the guidelines would curb racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants. "The impact, if there is any, will be impossible to judge ahead of time because the decision whether to use {racketeering charges} is made in individual cases" by Justice Department officials in Washington, he said.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In a memorandum describing the guidelines, Assistant Attorney General Edward Dennis Jr. said that government efforts to freeze defendants' assets pending racketeering prosecutions "have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press." But Mr. Runkel said the government isn't "backing off on these kinds of matters at all."

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Blue-chip advertisers have plenty of complaints about the magazines they advertise in, ranging from inadequate consumer research to ad "clutter" and a seemingly unchecked proliferation of special interest magazines.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Criticism from such big advertisers as Estee Lauder Inc., Colgate-Palmolive Co. and Seagram Co. put a damper on the euphoria at the American Magazine Conference here.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The conference opened Monday with glowing reports about consumer magazines' growth in circulation and advertising revenue in the past year.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> "Magazines are not providing us in-depth information on circulation," said Edgar Bronfman Jr., president and chief operating officer of Seagram, in a panel discussion. "How do readers feel about the magazine?
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> How deeply do they read it?
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Research doesn't tell us whether people actually do read the magazines they subscribe to."
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Reuben Mark, chief executive of Colgate-Palmolive, said advertisers lack detailed demographic and geographic breakdowns of magazines' audiences. "We need research that convinces us that magazines are a real value in reader's lives, that readers are really involved."
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The critics also lambasted the magazine industry for something executives often are very proud of: the growth in magazine titles during the 1980s.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Leonard Lauder, president and chief executive officer of Estee Lauder, said consumer magazines are suffering from what he called "niche-itis," the increasing number of magazines that target the idosyncratic interests of readers.
9 <TAB> 11 <TAB> "Niche-itis fragments our advertising dollars," said Mr. Lauder. "We are being over-magazined.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> We are constantly faced with deciding which partnerships {with magazines} we can keep." He added: "There's probably even a magazine for left-handed golfers . . . but the general interest magazine is something we all miss, and it should come back."
11 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Mr. Lauder also attacked what he sees as the wide imitation of Elle, a fashion magazine published by Diamandis Communications Inc., and criticized the practice of stacking ads at the front of magazines. "Readers don't want to face all those ad pages at the front of a magazine," he said.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Magazine editors did not take the criticisms lying down. "We spend a fortune on research information," said Steve Burzon, publisher of Meredith Corp. 's Metropolitan Home.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And Tina Brown, editor of Conde Nast Publications Inc. 's Vanity Fair, said advertisers are frequently asked to take advertising positions in the back of her magazine to relieve ad clutter. "But advertisers wouldn't think of it," she said.

1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Taiwan's USI Far East Corp., a petrochemical company, initialed the agreement with an unidentified Japanese contractor to build a naphtha cracker, according to Alson Lee, who heads the Philippine company set up to build and operate the complex.
2 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Mr. Lee, president of Luzon Petrochemical Corp., said the contract was signed Wednesday in Tokyo with USI Far East officials.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Contract details, however, haven't been made public.
4 <TAB> 6 <TAB> The complex is to be located in Batangas, about 70 miles south of Manila.
5 <TAB> 8 <TAB> USI Far East will hold a 60% stake in Luzon Petrochemical, according to papers signed with the Philippine government's Board of Investments.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> The proposed petrochemical plant would use naphtha to manufacture the petrochemicals propylene and ethylene and their resin derivatives, polypropylene and polyethylene.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> These are the raw materials used in making plastics.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> The contract signing represented a major step in the long-planned petrochemical project.
9 <TAB> 11 <TAB> At an estimated $360 million, the project would represent the single largest foreign investment in the Philippines since President Corazon Aquino took office in February 1986.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It also is considered critical to the country's efforts to both attract other investment from Taiwan and raise heavy industry capabilities.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The project has been in and out of the pipeline for more than a decade.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> However, workers can't break ground until legal maneuvers to block the complex are resolved, moves which caused the signing to remain questionable up to the last moment.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> As previously reported, a member of the Philippines' House of Representatives has sued to stop the plant.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> The legislator, Enrique Garcia, had actively backed the plant, but at the original site in his constituency northwest of Manila.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The country's Supreme Court dismissed the suit, but Mr. Garcia late last month filed for a reconsideration.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In addition, President Aquino has yet to sign into law a bill removing a stiff 48% tax on naphtha, the principal raw material to be used in the cracker.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> However, at a news conference Thursday, Mrs. Aquino backed the project and said her government was attempting to soothe the feelings of residents at the original site, adjacent to the government's major petroleum refinery in Bataan province. "We have tried our best to tell the people in Bataan that maybe this time it will not go to them, but certainly we will do our best to encourage other investors to go to their province," Mrs. Aquino told Manila-based foreign correspondents.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> The project appeared to be on the rocks earlier this month when the other major partner in the project, China General Plastics Corp., backed out.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> China General Plastics, another Taiwanese petrochemical manufacturer, was to have a 40% stake in Luzon Petrochemical.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> However, Mr. Lee said that USI Far East is confident other investors will take up the slack.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He said USI Far East has applied to both the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank's International Finance Corp. for financing that could include equity stakes.

2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Most of the Western European members of Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, the unofficial forum through which the U.S. and its allies align their export-control policies, are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in Paris Oct. 25 and 26.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> They plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools, computers and other high-technology products.
4 <TAB> 12 <TAB> But the Bush administration says it wants to see evidence that all Cocom members are complying fully with existing export-control procedures before it will support further liberalization.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> To make its point, it is challenging the Italian government to explain reports that Olivetti may have supplied the Soviet Union with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> The London Sunday Times, which first reported the U.S. concerns, cited a U.S. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that Olivetti exported $25 million in "embargoed, state-of-the-art, flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry." Olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in 1984.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> A State Department spokesman acknowledged that the U.S. is discussing the allegations with the Italian government and Cocom, but declined to confirm any details.
8 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Italian President Francesco Cossiga promised a quick investigation into whether Olivetti broke Cocom rules.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> President Bush called his attention to the matter during the Italian leader's visit here last week.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Olivetti has denied that it violated Cocom rules, asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the Italian authorities.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Although the legality of these sales is still an open question, the disclosure couldn't be better timed to support the position of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community. "It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting," said a Washington lobbyist for a number of U.S. computer companies.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export-control policies, reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies.

14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> But more recently, the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> However, these agencies generally agree that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization. "There's no evidence that the Soviet program to (illegally) acquire Western technology has diminished," said a State Department spokesman.

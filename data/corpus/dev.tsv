0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> The Justice Department is in the process of trying to gain control over a law that federal Judge David Sentelle recently called a "monster." Needless to say, he was talking about RICO.
1 <TAB> 6 <TAB> With its recently revised guidelines for RICO, Justice makes it clear that the law currently holds too many incentives for abuse by prosecutors.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The text of the "new policy" guidelines from the Criminal Division are reprinted nearby.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They strongly suggest that Justice's prosecutions of Drexel Burnham Lambert, Michael Milken and Princeton/Newport violated notions of fundamental fairness.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Justice is attempting to avoid a replay of these tactics.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This amounts to an extraordinary repudiation of the tenure of New York mayoral candidate and former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who was more inclined to gathering scalps than understanding markets.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> The new guidelines limit the pretrial forfeitures of assets of RICOed defendants and their investors, clients, bankers and others.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This follows earlier new guidelines from the Tax Division prohibiting Princeton/Newport-like tax cases from masquerading as RICO cases.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> The forfeiture memo cited "considerable criticism in the press, because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process." It told prosecutors not to seek forfeitures if there are "less intrusive" alternatives, such as bonds, and in any case not to seek forfeitures "disproportionate to the defendant's crime."
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> These changes come a tad late for Princeton/Newport, the first RICOed securities firm.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> It was forced into liquidation before trial when investors yanked their funds after the government demanded a huge pre-trial asset forfeiture.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Princeton/Newport investors, including McKinsey & Co. and the Harvard endowment, made the rational decision to withdraw their money; for the firm, the liquidation was sentence first, verdict later.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Prosecutors wanted $23.8 million in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some $400,000.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> The experience of Princeton/Newport and initiation of other RICO-forfeiture cases against legitimate businesses taught Drexel that a RICOed investment bank would be an ex-investment bank.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Drexel therefore agreed instead to an arrangement allowing it to plea to charges "which the company is not in a position to dispute" because of RICO. Part of Drexel's plea was to cut Mr. Milken loose.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> So after all the prosecutorial hoopla no one has established what, if anything, Drexel did wrong.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> So two cheers for the new rules.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Justice has finally recognized its employees' abuses, thanks largely to the demands for reform by former U.S. attorney in Washington Joseph diGenova, who wants to salvage RICO for real criminals.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But prosecutorial guidelines are effective only if someone at Justice is willing and able to supervise hyperactive prosecutors.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Judge Sentelle, of the appeals court in Washington, made this point at a Cato Institute conference last week in a remarkable speech titled, "RICO: The Monster That Ate Jurisprudence." He said ours is supposed to be "a government of laws not of men," and yet RICO defenders "tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against overbreadth of RICO." No prosecutorial guidelines, observed or unobserved, limit civil RICO cases by plaintiffs for damages.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> What now for Princeton/Newport officials, Drexel and Mr. Milken?
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Justice should review these cases to see what other prosecutorial abuses may have occurred.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> We suspect that Justice will some day agree that only the complete repeal of RICO can guarantee an end to injustices in its name.

1 <TAB> -1  <TAB> Commercial banks and property/casualty insurers, which together own about 36% of all municipal bonds, have been dumping their securities for weeks.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Last week, traders said, there were three institutional sellers for every buyer.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "Every day we're getting new bid lists" from would-be sellers, one trader said. "Most dealers cannot continue to absorb this supply."
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> As a result, yields on long-term muni bonds now stand at about 95% of long-term Treasury yields, the highest such level in more than two years.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> "There is incredible negative psychology building in the market," said Donna Avedisian, a vice president at Merrill Lynch & Co. "People are very concerned about who is going to step up to the plate and buy municipal bonds in the absence of institutional buyers." The yield on a group of 25 revenue bonds compiled by the Bond Buyer, a trade publication, now exceeds 7.50%.
6 <TAB> 8 <TAB> At this week's New York City bond sale, traders expect yields on the 20-year New York bonds to nearly match the 7.9% yield on 30-year Treasury bonds.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For an investor in the 28% federal tax bracket, 7.9% tax-free is the same as 10.38% on a taxable investment.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That's a taxable-equivalent yield nearly three percentage points more than the current yield on 30-year Treasury bonds.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> How quickly things change.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> This past summer, investors' appetite for municipal bonds seemed insatiable.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Individuals eager for tax-free income drove up bond prices, making state and local government debt one of the best-performing types of fixed-income investments during the period.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> But while analysts say that municipal bonds still offer good value, you wouldn't know it by the way institutional investors are rushing to dump their holdings.
13 <TAB> 23 <TAB> Bond market analysts say the institutional selling was triggered by several factors.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> Big banks such as Chemical Bank and Chase Manhattan, which have been taking heavy charges to expand their Third World loan-loss reserves, aren't looking for tax-exempt income. "We don't need the shelter of tax-free bonds," said a spokeswoman at Chemical.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> In recent weeks, traders said, Chemical has sold more than $1 billion of tax-free bonds.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The spokeswoman confirmed that the bank has significantly reduced its muni holdings, but couldn't immediately confirm the amount.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Insurance companies are rushing to sell before the end of the year, when some of their tax benefits associated with municipal bonds will be phased out.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> There is speculation that property/casualty firms will sell even more munis as they scramble to raise cash to pay claims related to Hurricane Hugo and the Northern California earthquake.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Fundamental factors are at work as well.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Muni bond holders are worried about the impact of a slowing economy on tax revenue, at a time when many state and local governments already face budget deficits and huge spending needs.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The recent natural disasters, and the need of many other cities to rebuild crumbling infrastructure, suggests that supply of new issues will continue to rise sharply -- even as demand tapers off.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "There is just so much going on that it's difficult to pick just one factor that's driving the market," said Ronald Ian Heller, vice president at First Chicago Capital Markets Inc., a subsidiary of First Chicago Corp.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> Some of the recent selling could actually be considered a positive sign.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> Mutual funds, for example, are said to be selling existing municipal bonds to raise cash to buy new issues.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> Because municipal bonds yields have risen at a time when interest rates generally have fallen, some portfolio managers are assuming that bonds bought now will appreciate in value as the municipal bond market rebounds.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> Ms. Avedisian believes that the mutual funds are selling muni bonds that have a negative convexity -- those that have appreciated in price slowly relative to the decline in interest rates.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Such bonds, she says, are those that are nearing their call date.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> But traders said the market's tone could pick up this week if New York City's $787 million bond offering goes well.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> The offering will include $729 million of 20-year tax-exempt bonds and $57.8 million of taxable bonds.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A few weeks ago, New York sold $750 million of tax-exempts.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> New York City bonds have been beaten down for three straight weeks.
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> On Friday, some issues fell nearly one point, or close to $10 for each $1,000 face amount.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> The sell-off in New York City bonds was triggered by concerns about the city's financial health and political uncertainty in view of the impending mayoral election.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The city's economy is growing weaker and expenditures are rising as tax revenue is falling.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "The city has issued so much supply recently that some people are getting a little concerned.
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> They'd like to see some other names in their portfolios," said Michael S. Appelbaum, first vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton.
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> But he thinks investors may be overreacting to the market's problems.
38 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Overall, he says, municipal prices are "very cheap" and represent an "excellent buying opportunity."

42 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The issue's yield rose to 7.93% from 7.88%.
43 <TAB> 44 <TAB> Late Thursday, the Treasury said it needed to raise $17 billion quickly and would do so by issuing new securities this week.
44 <TAB> 45 <TAB> Credit market analysts expected the Treasury to cancel today's three-month and six-month sale and to sell $17 billion of cash management bills.
45 <TAB> 46 <TAB> Instead, the Treasury announced it would sell $2 billion of 51-day cash management bills today and said that the weekly sale of $15.6 billion of three-month and six-month bills will take place today, as usual, but the sale will settle tomorrow instead of Thursday.
46 <TAB> -1 <TAB> By moving the settlement date ahead, the Treasury can raise money under the $2.87 trillion debt ceiling that is in effect through tomorrow, after which it reverts to $2.8 trillion.
47 <TAB> 48 <TAB> The market also was hurt by rumors that Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru, a Japanese brokerage firm, was unloading some of the 30-year bonds it recently purchased.
48 <TAB> 49 <TAB> One dealer said the talk was that the firm sold about $500 million of bellwether 30-year bonds.
49 <TAB> 50 <TAB> The firm is thought to have purchased up to $3 billion of 30-year bonds in a buying spree on Wednesday and the previous Thursday.

52 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Nippon Kangyo's moves puzzled traders and created confusion among potential investors, many of whom decided to stay out of the market.

6 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Edward M.

15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It does prolong the pain somewhat."
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Maxwell said unless the company can start shipments of the new product sometime this quarter, the fourth-quarter loss is likely to be "comparable to the third quarter's."

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> A surprising surge in the U.S. trade deficit raised fears that the nation's export drive has stalled, and caused new turmoil in financial markets.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> The merchandise trade deficit widened in August to $10.77 billion, the Commerce Department reported, a sharp deterioration from July's $8.24 billion and the largest deficit of any month this year.
2 <TAB> 4 <TAB> Exports fell for the second month in a row, while imports rose to a record.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "This is one of the worst trade releases we've had since the dollar troughed out in 1987," said Geoffrey Dennis, chief international economist at James Capel Inc. Like most analysts, Mr. Dennis was hesitant to read too much into one month's numbers; but he said, "It indicates perhaps that the balance in the U.S. economy is not as good as we've been led to believe."
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> The number had a troubling effect on Wall Street, suggesting that more fundamental economic problems may underlie last Friday's stock market slide.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 60 points after the report's release, before recovering to close 18.65 points lower at 2638.73.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "This bad trade number raises some deeper issues about the market decline," said Norman Robertson, chief economist for Mellon Bank. "It raises questions about more deep-seated problems, the budget deficit and the trade deficit and the seeming lack of ability to come to grips with them."
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> The trade report drew yet another unsettling parallel to October 1987.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> On Oct. 14 of that year, the announcement of an unusually large August trade deficit helped trigger a steep market decline.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> The slide continued until the record 508-point market drop on Oct. 19.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In 1987, however, the news was the latest in a string of disappointments on trade, while the current report comes after a period of improvement.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The bleak trade report was played down by the Bush administration.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher called the worsening trade figures "disappointing after two very good months." And White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the deficit was "an unwelcome increase," adding that "we're hopeful that it simply is a one-month situation and will turn around."
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> But the figures reinforced the view of many private analysts that the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit has run out of steam.
14 <TAB> 18 <TAB> "The figures today add further evidence to support the view that the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit has essentially stalled out at a level of about a $110 billion annual rate," said Jeffrey Scott, a research fellow at the Institute for International Economics here. "That's still an improvement over last year, but it leads one to conclude that basically we've gotten all the mileage we can out of past dollar depreciation and past marginal cuts in the federal budget deficit."
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Exports declined for the second consecutive month in August, slipping 0.2% to $30.41 billion, the Commerce Department reported.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Imports, on the other hand, leaped 6.4% to a record $41.18 billion.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Not only was August's deficit far worse than July's, but the government revised the July figure substantially from the $7.58 billion deficit it had initially reported last month.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> Many economists contend that deep cuts in the U.S. budget deficit are needed before further trade improvement can occur.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital, overwhelming the nation's capacity to export. "People are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits, but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem," said Mr. Robertson.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> In addition, the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of U.S. products in overseas markets and hurt the country's competitiveness.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> Since March, exports have been virtually flat.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> At the same time, William T. Archey, international vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, notes: "Clearly the stronger dollar has made imports more attractive" by causing their prices to decline.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> Most economists expect the slowing U.S. economy to curb demand for imports.
24 <TAB> 26 <TAB> But they foresee little substantial progress in exports unless the dollar and the federal budget deficit come down.
25 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "The best result we could get from these numbers would be to see the administration and Congress get serious about putting the U.S. on an internationally competitive economic footing," said Howard Lewis, vice president of international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers. "That must start with cutting the federal budget deficit."
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> August's decline in exports reflected decreases in sales of industrial supplies, capital goods and food abroad and increases in sales of motor vehicles, parts and engines.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The jump in imports stemmed from across-the-board increases in purchases of foreign goods.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> People start their own businesses for many reasons.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> But a chance to fill out sales-tax records is rarely one of them.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> Red tape is the bugaboo of small business.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> Ironically, the person who wants to run his or her own business is probably the active, results-oriented sort most likely to hate meeting the rules and record-keeping demands of federal, state and local regulators.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Yet every business owner has to face the mound of forms and regulations -- and often is the only one available to tackle it.
5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> There is hope of change.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Last week, Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R., Wyo.) held hearings on a bill to strengthen an existing law designed to reduce regulatory hassles for small businesses. "A great many federal regulations are meant for larger entities and don't really apply to small businesses," says Marian Jacob, a legislative aide to Sen. Wallop.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Other lawmakers are busy trying to revive the recently lapsed Paperwork Reduction Act, which many feel benefited small enterprises.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Thus, optimistic entrepreneurs await a promised land of less red tape -- just as soon as Uncle Sam gets around to arranging it.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Meanwhile, they tackle the mounds of paper -- and fantasize about a dream world where bulk-mail postal regulations and government inspectors are banished.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> To find out what red tape riles entrepreneurs most, the Journal asked a completely unscientific, random sample of business owners to fantasize about the forms and regulations they would most like to get lost in the mail.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Some entrepreneurs say the red tape they most love to hate is red tape they would also hate to lose.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> They concede that much of the government meddling that torments them is essential to the public good, and even to their own businesses.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> Rules that set standards for products or govern business behavior, generally the best regarded form of red tape, "create a level playing field and keep unscrupulous competitors away," says Sidney West, president of TechDesign International Inc., a Springfield, Va., business that designs telecommunication and other products.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. West cites the Federal Communications Commission and its standards for telecommunications equipment: "They monitor product quality and prevent junk from flooding the market."
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> Some gripes about red tape are predictable: Architects complain about a host of building regulations, auto leasing companies about car insurance rules.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> Determining when handicapped access is required can be a nightmare for architects, says Mark Dooling, president of Dooling & Co., a Newton, Mass., architectural firm.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> There is such a maze of federal, state and local codes that "building inspectors are backing away from interpreting them," Mr. Dooling says.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> Taxi, leasing and other companies that maintain fleets of vehicles devote substantial resources to complying with state insurance laws and a host of agencies. "It's very costly and time-consuming," says Phil Rosen, a partner in Fleet & Leasing Management Inc., a Boston car-leasing company.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> One senior executive at his firm spends nearly 20% of his time on insurance, he says.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Other forms of red tape are more pervasive.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The most onerous, many entrepreneurs say, is the record-keeping and filing required by tax authorities.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Complying with environmental and workplace regulations runs a close second.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But gripes run the gamut.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Here is the red tape that irks surveyed business owners the most:
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS: Next to medical insurance, "costs of compliance" are the fastest-growing expense at Impco Inc., a Providence, R.I., chemical company.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> Peter Gebhard, the company's owner, says spending on regulatory paper work and the people to do it -- mostly to comply with federal, state and local environmental laws -- will rise almost 30% this year to $100,000.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Gebhard adds that spending on environmental red tape amounts to between 6.5% and 7.5% of Impco's total operating expenses.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> Eastern Reproduction Corp., a Waltham, Mass., maker of thin metal precision parts, must report to five federal and state agencies as well as to local fire, police, hospital and plumbing authorities, says Robert Maguire, president.
29 <TAB> -1 <TAB> One state environmental regulator returned a report because "it wasn't heavy enough, it couldn't have been correct," Mr. Maguire says.
30 <TAB> -1 <TAB> WITHHOLDING RULES: Employers must deposit withholding taxes exceeding $3,000 within three days after payroll -- or pay stiff penalties -- and that's a big problem for small businesses.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It's especially nettlesome "if you're on the road and you're the one responsible," says Eddie Brown, president of Brown Capital Management Inc., a Baltimore money-management firm.
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> EMPLOYEE MANUALS: Revising employee manuals on pensions, health care and other subjects costs over $25,000 a year for Bert Giguiere, president of Professional Agricultural Management Inc., a Fresno, Calif., provider of business services to farmers.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> An employer leaves itself open to a great deal of liability if its employee manuals don't reflect the most recent laws, he says.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But the ever-changing laws are usually so complicated and confusing that "you need professionals to help you; you can't do it yourself," he adds.
35 <TAB> -1 <TAB> PENSION AND PROFIT-SHARING RULES: Complying with these is enough to make business owners look forward to their own pension days.
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> Yearly changes in federal benefit laws force small businesses to repeatedly re-evaluate and redesign existing plans.
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> Alice Fixx, who runs her own public-relations concern in New York, says she has had to overhaul her pension and profit-sharing plans three times in the past three years. "It doesn't increase benefits, but it's costly and time-consuming," Ms. Fixx says.
38 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Compliance added 15% to 20% to her accounting bill last year, she says.
39 <TAB> 40 <TAB> SALES TAX RECORDS: Advertising agencies and other service companies are exempt from city and state sales tax in most locales -- but the exemption comes at a price of exhaustive records and rigorous reviews.
40 <TAB> -1 <TAB> To justify their exempt status and avoid penalties, these businesses must show once a year that each and every transaction on which they didn't pay sales tax was a legitimate business expense.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Mobil Corp. is in the midst of cutting back its exploration and production group, which finds and develops oil and gas reserves in the U.S., by as much as 15% as part of a new restructuring of that sector of its business.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Management advised employees Friday that it was going to reduce employment in production operations of the group by 8%, or 400 people.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> The exploration side of the unit has recently undergone a similar overhaul, during which it also lost as many as 400 employees, a company spokesman said in response to questions.
3 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Mobil Exploration & Producing U.S. Inc., the group involved, currently has a work force of somewhat less than 5,000.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A few years ago, Mobil restructured the entire company during an industrywide shakeout.

7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mobil officials said that it is unlikely any additional charges related to this move will be taken in future quarters.
8 <TAB> 10 <TAB> On Wednesday, Mobil will begin offering separation packages and voluntary retirement in its U.S. production operation.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mobil officials said they have been studying ways of streamlining these operations since early this year.

12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Field offices at New Orleans; Houston; Denver; Midland, Tex.; Bakersfield, Calif.; Oklahoma City; and Liberal, Kan., will be maintained.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> The stock market's dizzying gyrations during the past few days have made a lot of individual investors wish they could buy some sort of insurance.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> After all, they won't soon forget the stock bargains that became available after the October 1987 crash.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But while they want to be on the alert for similar buying opportunities now, they're afraid of being hammered by another terrifying plunge.
3 <TAB> 4 <TAB> The solution, at least for some investors, may be a hedging technique that's well known to players in the stock-options market.
4 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Called a "married put," the technique is carried out by purchasing a stock and simultaneously buying a put option on that stock.
5 <TAB> 9 <TAB> It's like "fire insurance," says Harrison Roth, the senior options strategist at Cowen & Co.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Because a put option gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell a fixed number of shares of the stock at a stated price on or before the option's expiration date, the investor is protected against a sudden drop in the stock's price.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> But most investment advisers don't recommend using married puts all the time.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That's because the cost of buying put options eats into an investor's profit when stock prices rise.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "This is the type of fire insurance you only buy when the nearby woods are on fire," says Mr. Roth. "You always want your house insured, but you don't always feel the need for your investments to be insured."
10 <TAB> 18 <TAB> In addition to hedging new stock purchases, the married-put technique can be used to protect stocks that an investor already owns.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> In either case, the investor faces three possible outcomes:
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> -- If the stock goes up in price between now and the put's expiration date, the put will probably expire worthless.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> The investor will be out the cost of the put, which is called the "premium," and this loss will reduce the stock-market profit.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> -- If the stock stays at the same price between now and the put's expiration date, the investor's loss will be limited to the cost of the put, less any amount realized from a closing sale of the put.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> The worst-case scenario would be if the put expires worthless.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> -- If the price of the stock declines, the put will increase in value.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Once the stock price is less than the exercise price, or "strike price," of the put, the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> The put establishes a minimum selling price for the stock during its life.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> When a stock falls below the put's strike price, the investor simply sells the stock at a loss and simultaneously sells the put at a profit.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Or, the investor can exercise the put, by tendering the stock to his or her broker in return for payment from another investor who has sold a put on the same stock.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Brokers handle such transactions through the Options Clearing Corp., which guarantees all option trades.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> The accompanying table shows how this strategy would work for three stocks.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> Though not reflected in the table, an investor should know that the cost of the option insurance can be partially offset by any dividends that the stock pays.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> For example, Tenneco Inc. pays a quarterly dividend of 76 cents, which would be received before the February option expires and, thus, reduce the cost of using the technique by that amount.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> In this case, the investor's risk wouldn't exceed 3.6% of the total investment.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> To simplify the calculations, commissions on the option and underlying stock aren't included in the table.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> There are more than 650 stocks on which options may be bought and sold, including some over-the-counter stocks.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> But some investors might prefer a simpler strategy then hedging their individual holdings.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> They can do this by purchasing "index puts," which are simply put options on indexes that match broad baskets of stocks.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> For instance, the most popular index option is the S&P 100 option, commonly called the OEX.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> It is based on the stocks that make up Standard & Poor's 100-stock index.
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> Unlike options on individual issues, index options are settled only in cash, and no stock is ever tendered.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> But while index options are convenient, they have several disadvantages.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> For one thing, an investor's portfolio might not closely match the S&P 100.
35 <TAB> 36 <TAB> As a result, the OEX insurance may or may not fully protect an investor's holdings in the event of a market decline.
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> In addition, OEX options were suspended from trading last Friday afternoon, after the stock-market sell-off got under way and trading in the S&P-500 futures contract was halted.
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> So an investor who wanted to realize a profit on OEX puts after the trading suspension would have been out of luck.
38 <TAB> 39 <TAB> On the other hand, only a handful of individual issues were suspended from trading on Friday.
39 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Normally, once the underlying investment is suspended from trading, the options on those investments also don't trade.
40 <TAB> 41 <TAB> Ultimately, whether the insurance provided by purchasing puts is worthwhile depends on the cost of the options.
41 <TAB> 42 <TAB> That cost rises in times of high market volatility.
42 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But it still might be cheaper than taking a major hit.
43 <TAB> 44 <TAB> The protection from using married puts is clearly superior to that afforded by another options strategy some investors consider using during troubled times: selling call options on stocks the investor owns.
44 <TAB> 45 <TAB> A call option is similar to a put, except that it gives its owner the right to buy shares at a stated price until expiration.
45 <TAB> 46 <TAB> Selling a call option gives an investor a small buffer against a stock-market decline.
46 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That's because it reduces the cost of the stock by the amount of premium received from the sale of the call.
47 <TAB> 48 <TAB> But if the price of the stock rises above the strike price of the option, the stock is almost certain to be called away.
48 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And in that case, the investor misses out on any major upside gain.
49 <TAB> -1 <TAB> These calculations exclude the effect of commissions paid and dividends received from the stock.
50 <TAB> -1 <TAB> All prices are as of Monday's close.

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Predicting the financial results of computer firms has been a tough job lately.
1 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Take Microsoft Corp., the largest maker of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> In July, the company stunned Wall Street with the prediction that growth in the personal computer business overall would be only 10% in 1990, a modest increase when compared with the sizzling expansion of years past.
3 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Investors -- taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the offing -- reacted by selling the company's stock, which lost $3.25 that day to close at $52 in national over-the-counter trading.
4 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But that was all of three months ago.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> Last week, Microsoft said it expects revenue for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 to increase 34%.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The announcement caused the company's stock to surge $6.50 to close at $75.50 a share.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Microsoft's surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for reassurances about the financial health of the computer firms. "It's hard to know what to expect at this point," said Peter Rogers, an analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co. "The industry defies characterization."
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> To illustrate, Mr. Rogers said that of the 14 computer-related firms he follows, half will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year's results, and half above those results.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Among those companies expected to have a down quarter are Hewlett-Packard Co., Amdahl Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc., generally solid performers in the past.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> International Business Machines Corp. also is expected to report disappointing results.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Apple Computer Inc., meanwhile, is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended Sept.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Another contradictory message comes from Businessland Inc., a computer retailer.
13 <TAB> 14 <TAB> In July, the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from Apple and IBM had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended June 30 to $7.4 million, or 23 cents a share.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> This month, however, Businessland warned investors that results for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 hadn't met expectations.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The company said it expects earnings of 14 to 17 cents a share, down from 25 cents a share in the year-earlier period.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> While the earnings picture confuses, observers say the major forces expected to shape the industry in the coming year are clearer.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Companies will continue to war over standards.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> In computer publishing, a battle over typefaces is hurting Adobe Systems Inc., which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> Until recently, Adobe had a lock on the market for image software, but last month Apple, Adobe's biggest customer, and Microsoft rebelled.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> Now the two firms are collaborating on an alternative to Adobe's approach, and analysts say they are likely to carry IBM, the biggest seller of personal computers, along with them.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The short-term outlook for Adobe's business, however, appears strong.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> The company is beginning to ship a new software program that's being heralded as a boon for owners of low-end printers sold by Apple.
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The program is aimed at improving the quality of printed material.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> John Warnock, Adobe's chief executive officer, said the Mountain View, Calif., company has been receiving 1,000 calls a day about the product since it was demonstrated at a computer publishing conference several weeks ago.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> Meanwhile, competition between various operating systems, which control the basic functions of a computer, spells trouble for software firms generally. "It creates uncertainty and usually slows down sales," said Russ Crabs, an analyst at Soundview Financial Group.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> Mr. Crabs said this probably is behind the expected weak performance of Aldus Corp., maker of a widely used computer publishing program.
27 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He expects Aldus to report earnings of 21 cents a share on revenues of $19.5 million for its third quarter, compared with earnings of 30 cents a share on revenue of 20.4 million in the year-earlier period.
28 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Aldus officials couldn't be reached for comment.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> On the other hand, the battle of the bus is expected to grow increasingly irrelevant.
30 <TAB> 31 <TAB> A bus is the data highway within a computer.
31 <TAB> -1 <TAB> IBM is backing one type of bus called microchannel, while the nine other leading computer makers, including H-P and Compaq Computer Corp., have chosen another method.
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> "Users don't care about the bus," said Daniel Benton, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> He said Apple's family of Macintosh computers, for instance, uses four different buses "and no one seems to mind."
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The gap between winners and laggards will grow.
35 <TAB> 36 <TAB> In personal computers, Apple, Compaq and IBM are expected to tighten their hold on their business.
36 <TAB> 37 <TAB> At the same time, second-tier firms will continue to lose ground.
37 <TAB> 40 <TAB> Some lagging competitors even may leave the personal computer business altogether.
38 <TAB> 39 <TAB> Wyse Technology, for instance, is considered a candidate to sell its troubled operation. "Wyse has done well establishing a distribution business, but they haven't delivered products that sell," said Kimball Brown, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities.
39 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Brown estimates Wyse, whose terminals business is strong, will report a loss of 12 cents a share for its quarter ended Sept.
40 <TAB> 41 <TAB> Personal-computer makers will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms.
41 <TAB> 43 <TAB> Ever-more powerful desk-top computers, designed with one or more microprocessors as their "brains," are expected to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive minicomputers and mainframes.
42 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "The guys that make traditional hardware are really being obsoleted by microprocessor-based machines," said Mr. Benton.
43 <TAB> 46 <TAB> As a result of this trend, longtime powerhouses H-P, IBM and Digital Equipment Corp. are scrambling to counterattack with microprocessor-based systems of their own.
44 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But they will have to act quickly.
45 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Benton expects Compaq to unveil a family of high-end personal computers later this year that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of desk-top machines.

2 <TAB> 4 <TAB> The results, which are in line with analysts' estimates, reflect "a continued improvement in our U.S. business," said James Treybig, Tandem's chief executive officer.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> In the year-earlier period, Tandem reported net income of $30.1 million, or 31 cents a share, on revenue of $383.9 million.

5 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Analysts have predicted that the Cupertino, Calif., company will report revenue of $430 million to $460 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Commenting on the results for the quarter, Mr. Treybig said the strength of the company's domestic business came as "a surprise" to him, noting that sales "in every region of the U.S. exceeded our plan."
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The company's U.S. performance was helped by "a record quarter for new customers," he said.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> Tandem makes "fault-tolerant" computers -- machines with built-in backup systems -- that run stock exchanges, networks of automatic tellers and other complex computer systems.
9 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Tomorrow the company is scheduled to announce its most powerful computer ever, which for the first time will bring it into direct competition with makers of mainframe computers.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Tandem's new high-end computer is called Cyclone.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Prices for the machine, which can come in various configurations, are $2 million to $10 million.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Analysts expect the new computer to wrest a hefty slice of business away from IBM, the longtime leader in mainframes.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "We believe they could siphon perhaps two to three billion dollars from IBM" over the next few years, said George Weiss, an analyst at the Gartner group.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> That will spur Tandem's growth. "I'd be disappointed if the company grew by less than 20% next year," said John Levinson, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> IBM is expected to respond to Tandem's Cyclone by discounting its own mainframes, which analysts say are roughly three times the price of a comparable system from Tandem. "Obviously IBM can give bigger discounts to users immediately," said Mr. Weiss.
16 <TAB> 17 <TAB> But Mr. Treybig questions whether that will be enough to stop Tandem's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from Big Blue's machines. "The answer isn't price reductions, but new systems," he said.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Nevertheless, Tandem faces a variety of challenges, the biggest being that customers generally view the company's computers as complementary to IBM's mainframes.
18 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Even Mr. Treybig is reluctant to abandon this notion, insisting that Tandem's new machines aren't replacements for IBM's mainframes.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "We're after a little bigger niche," he said.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> General Motors Corp. 's general counsel hopes to cut the number of outside law firms the auto maker uses from about 700 to 200 within two years.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Harry J. Pearce, named general counsel in May 1987, says the reduction is a cost-cutting measure and an effort to let the No. 1 auto maker's 134-lawyer in-house legal department take on matters it is better equipped and trained to handle.
2 <TAB> 3 <TAB> GM trimmed about 40 firms from its approved local counsel list, Mr. Pearce says.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The move is consistent with a trend for corporate legal staffs to do more work in-house, instead of farming it out to law firms.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> Mr. Pearce set up GM's first in-house litigation group in May with four lawyers, all former assistant U.S. attorneys with extensive trial experience.
5 <TAB> 6 <TAB> He intends to add to the litigation staff.
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Among the types of cases the in-house litigators handle are disputes involving companies doing business with GM and product-related actions, including one in which a driver is suing GM for damages resulting from an accident.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Mr. Pearce has also encouraged his staff to work more closely with GM's technical staffs to help prevent future litigation.
8 <TAB> 9 <TAB> GM lawyers have been working with technicians to develop more uniform welding procedures -- the way a vehicle is welded has a lot to do with its durability.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The lawyers also monitor suits to identify specific automobile parts that cause the biggest legal problems.
10 <TAB> 11 <TAB> Mr. Pearce says law firms with the best chance of retaining or winning business with GM will be those providing the highest-quality service at the best cost -- echoing similar directives from GM's auto operations to suppliers.
11 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This doesn't necessarily mean larger firms have an advantage; Mr. Pearce said GM works with a number of smaller firms it regards highly.
12 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Pearce has shaken up GM's legal staff by eliminating all titles and establishing several new functions, including a special-projects group that has made films on safety and drunk driving.
13 <TAB> 15 <TAB> FEDERAL PROSECUTORS are concluding fewer criminal cases with trials.
14 <TAB> 17 <TAB> That's a finding of a new study of the Justice Department by researchers at Syracuse University.
15 <TAB> 16 <TAB> David Burnham, one of the authors, says fewer trials probably means a growing number of plea bargains.
16 <TAB> 20 <TAB> In 1980, 18% of federal prosecutions concluded at trial; in 1987, only 9% did.
17 <TAB> 21 <TAB> The study covered 11 major U.S. attorneys' offices -- including those in Manhattan and Brooklyn, N.Y., and New Jersey -- from 1980 to 1987.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> The Justice Department rejected the implication that its prosecutors are currently more willing to plea bargain. "Our felony caseloads have been consistent for 20 years," with about 15% of all prosecutions going to trial, a department spokeswoman said.
19 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The discrepancy is somewhat perplexing in that the Syracuse researchers said they based their conclusions on government statistics.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "One possible explanation for this decline" in taking cases to trial, says Mr. Burnham, "is that the number of defendants being charged with crimes by all U.S. attorneys has substantially increased."
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> In 1980, the study says, prosecutors surveyed filed charges against 25 defendants for each 100,000 people aged 18 years and older.
22 <TAB> 23 <TAB> In 1987, prosecutors filed against 35 defendants for every 100,000 adults.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> Another finding from the study: Prosecutors set significantly different priorities.
24 <TAB> 25 <TAB> The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office stressed criminal cases from 1980 to 1987, averaging 43 for every 100,000 adults.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> But the New Jersey U.S. attorney averaged 16.
26 <TAB> -1 <TAB> On the civil side, the Manhattan prosecutor filed an average of only 11 cases for every 100,000 adults during the same period; the San Francisco U.S. attorney averaged 79.

32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> The U.S. attorney's office, in documents it filed in response, said Mrs. Marcos was making the "fanciful -- and factually unsupported -- claim that she was kidnapped into this country" in order to obtain classified material in the case.
33 <TAB> 34 <TAB> The office also said Mrs. Marcos and her husband weren't brought to the U.S. against their will after Mr. Marcos was ousted as president.

0 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Defense intellectuals have complained for years that the Pentagon cannot determine priorities because it has no strategy.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> Last April, the new defense secretary, Richard Cheney, acknowledged that, "given an ideal world, we'd have a nice, neat, orderly process.
2 <TAB> -1 <TAB> We'd do the strategy and then we'd come around and do the budget.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This city doesn't work that way." With a five-year defense plan costing more than $1.6 trillion, it's about time we put together a defense strategy that works in Washington.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> This won't happen until strategists come down from their ivory tower and learn to work in the real world of limited budgets and uncertain futures.
5 <TAB> 9 <TAB> As it is, we identify national goals and the threats to these goals, we shape a strategy to counter these threats, we determine the forces needed to execute the strategy, before finally forging the budgets needed to build and maintain the forces.
6 <TAB> -1 <TAB> These procedures consume millions of man-hours of labor and produce tons of paper, and each year, their end product -- the Five Year Defense Plan -- promptly melts away.
7 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The graph on the left shows how this happens (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 30, 1989).
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Compare the past eight five-year plans with actual appropriations.
9 <TAB> 11 <TAB> The Pentagon's strategists produce budgets that simply cannot be executed because they assume a defense strategy depends only on goals and threats.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Strategy, however, is about possibilities, not hopes and dreams.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> By ignoring costs, U.S. strategists abdicate their responsibility for hard decisions.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> That puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others: bean counters, budgeteers, and pork-barrelers.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> These people have different agendas.
14 <TAB> -1 <TAB> And as a result -- as the recent vote by the House to undo Mr. Cheney's program terminations suggests -- the preservation of jobs is becoming the real goal of defense "strategy."
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> How can we turn this situation around?
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Reform starts in the Pentagon.
17 <TAB> 18 <TAB> Strategists should consider the impact of budget uncertainties at the beginning of the planning process.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> They ought to examine how a range of optimistic to pessimistic budget scenarios would change the defense program.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> They would then develop priorities by identifying the least painful program cuts as they moved from higher to lower budgets.
20 <TAB> -1 <TAB> They would also identify the best way to add programs, should the budget come in at higher levels.
21 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This kind of contingency analysis is common in war planning and business planning.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> There is no reason that it can not be done for defense planning.
23 <TAB> 24 <TAB> Two steps are necessary to translate this idea into action.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Step 1 cleans up our books.
25 <TAB> 26 <TAB> Our five-year plan contains three accounting devices -- negative money, an above guidance management reserve and optimistic inflation estimates -- which understate the spending the Pentagon has committed itself to by almost $100 billion.
26 <TAB> 27 <TAB> Negative money was invented in 1988 to make the 1990-94 Five Year Defense Plan conform to the numbers in President Reagan's final budget submission to Congress.
27 <TAB> 28 <TAB> That plan exceeded the numbers contained in his budget message by $45 billion.
28 <TAB> 29 <TAB> To make the books balance, as is required by law, somebody invented a new budget line item that simply subtracted $45 billion.
29 <TAB> 30 <TAB> It is known in the Pentagon as the "negative wedge."
30 <TAB> 34 <TAB> The Pentagon argues that the negative wedge is the net effect of $22 billion in the as-yet unidentified procurement reductions that it intends to find in future years and $23 billion in an "above guidance" management reserve that accounts for undefined programs that will materialize in the future.
31 <TAB> 32 <TAB> The 1990 plan also assumes inflation will decline to 1.7% by 1994.
32 <TAB> 33 <TAB> Most forecasters, including those in the Congressional Budget Office, assume inflation will be in excess of 4% in each of those five years.
33 <TAB> -1 <TAB> At that rate, the defense plan is underfunded by $48 billion.
34 <TAB> -1 <TAB> By adding the negative wedge and recalculating the remaining program using a more probable inflation estimate, we arrive at a baseline program costing $1.7 trillion between 1990 and 1994.
35 <TAB> 37 <TAB> Step 2 examines how four progressively lower budget scenarios would change the baseline and how these changes would affect our national security.
36 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The graph on the right (which assumes a 4% rate of inflation), places these scenarios in the context of recent appropriations (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 30, 1989).
37 <TAB> 38 <TAB> Note how the baseline program assumes a sharp increase in future appropriations.
38 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Step 2 will answer the question: What happens if these increases do not materialize?
39 <TAB> 40 <TAB> Scenario 1, known as the "Constant Dollar Freeze," reimburses the Pentagon for inflation only -- it slopes upward at 4% per year.
40 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This scenario has been the rough position of the U.S. Senate since 1985, and it reduces the baseline by $106 billion between 1990 and 1994.
41 <TAB> 42 <TAB> Scenario 3, the "Current Dollar Freeze," has been the approximate position of the House of Representatives for about four years.
42 <TAB> 43 <TAB> It freezes the budget at its current level, and forces the Pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until 1994.
43 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This reduces the baseline by $229 billion.
44 <TAB> 45 <TAB> Scenario 2 extends the recent compromises between the House and the Senate; it splits the difference between Scenarios 1 and 3, by increasing the budget at 2% per year.
45 <TAB> 46 <TAB> It reduces the baseline by $169 billion.
46 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Finally, Scenario 4 reduces the budget by 2% per year for the next five years -- a total reduction of $287 billion.
47 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This can be thought of as a pessimistic prediction, perhaps driven by the sequestering effects of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law or possibly a relaxation of tensions with the Soviet Union.
48 <TAB> 49 <TAB> The strategic planners in the Joint Chiefs of Staff would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario, maximizing strengths and minimizing weaknesses.
49 <TAB> 50 <TAB> They would conclude their efforts by producing a comprehensive net assessment for each plan -- including the assumptions made, an analysis of its deficiencies and limitations, the impact on national security, and the best strategy for working around these limitations.
50 <TAB> -1 <TAB> This exercise would reveal the true cost of a particular program by forcing the strategists to make hard decisions.
51 <TAB> 52 <TAB> If, for example, they choose to keep the B-2 Stealth bomber, they would have to sacrifice more and more other programs -- such as carrier battlegroups or army divisions -- as they moved toward lower budget levels.
52 <TAB> -1 <TAB> These trade-offs would evolve priorities by revealing when the cost of the B-2 became prohibitive.
53 <TAB> 54 <TAB> Some may be tempted to argue that the idea of a strategic review merely resurrects the infamous Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) concept of the Carter administration.
54 <TAB> 55 <TAB> But ZBB did not involve the strategic planners in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and therefore degenerated into a bean-counting drill driven by budget politics.
55 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Anyway, ZBB's procedures were so cumbersome that everyone involved was crushed under a burden of marginalia.
56 <TAB> -1 <TAB> A strategic review is fundamentally different.
57 <TAB> 61 <TAB> It would be run by the joint chiefs under simple directions: Produce the best possible force for each budget scenario and provide the Secretary of Defense with a comprehensive net assessment of how that force could be used to achieve U.S. goals.
58 <TAB> 59 <TAB> It might be feared that even thinking about lower budgets will hurt national security because the door will be opened to opportunistic budget cutting by an irresponsible Congress.
59 <TAB> 60 <TAB> This argument plays well in the atmosphere of gaming and mistrust permeating the Pentagon and Congress, and unfortunately, there is some truth to it.
60 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But in the end, it must be rejected for logical as well as moral reasons.
61 <TAB> 67 <TAB> To say that the Pentagon should act irresponsibly because acting responsibly will provoke Congress into acting irresponsibly leads to the conclusion that the Pentagon should deliberately exaggerate its needs in the national interest; in other words, that it is justified in committing a crime -- lying to Congress -- because it is morally superior.
62 <TAB> 64 <TAB> Strategy is not a game between the Pentagon and Congress; it is the art of the possible in a world where constraints force us to choose between unpleasant or imperfect alternatives.
63 <TAB> -1 <TAB> If we want meaningful priorities, we must understand the trade-offs they imply before we make commitments.
64 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Strategy is not a separate event in an idealized sequence of discrete events; it is a way of thinking that neutralizes threats to our interests in a manner consistent with our financial, cultural and physical limitations.

0 <TAB> 1 <TAB> Israel has launched a new effort to prove the Palestine Liberation Organization continues to practice terrorism, and thus to persuade the U.S. to break off talks with the group.
1 <TAB> 2 <TAB> U.S. officials, however, said they aren't buying the Israeli argument.
2 <TAB> 4 <TAB> Israeli counterterrorism officials provided the State Department with a 20-page list of recent terrorist incidents they attribute directly to forces controlled by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
3 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Mr. Arafat publicly renounced terrorism Dec. 15, satisfying the U.S. precondition for a direct "dialogue" with the PLO.
4 <TAB> 5 <TAB> A U.S. counterterrorism official said experts are studying the Israeli list. "We have no independent evidence linking Fatah to any acts of terrorism since Dec. 15, 1988," he said, referring to the specific PLO group that Mr. Arafat heads. "So far, this list doesn't change our view.
5 <TAB> 10 <TAB> Israel wants to end the dialogue, but our analysts take a different view than theirs."
6 <TAB> 7 <TAB> Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's top adviser on counterterrorism, Yigal Carmon, was here Monday to present the report to members of Congress, reporters and others.
7 <TAB> 8 <TAB> Mr. Carmon said he also presented the list last week to William Brown, U.S. Ambassador to Israel.
8 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Separately, the New York Times reported that the Israeli government had provided its correspondent in Jerusalem with different documents that Israel said prove the PLO has been conducting terrorism from the occupied Arab territories.
9 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The State Department said it hasn't yet seen copies of those papers.
10 <TAB> -1 <TAB> "If the dialogue was based on the assumption that Arafat or the PLO would stop terrorism, and we have evidence of continued terrorism, what would be the logical conclusion?" Mr. Carmon asked.
11 <TAB> 12 <TAB> Israel has long claimed Mr. Arafat never meant to renounce terrorism, particularly because he and his lieutenants reserved the right to press "armed struggle" against the Jewish state.
12 <TAB> 13 <TAB> Now, Jerusalem says it is backing up its contention with detailed accounts of alleged terrorist acts and plans linked to Mr. Arafat.
13 <TAB> -1 <TAB> It blames most of these on Fatah.
14 <TAB> 15 <TAB> The new accusations come at a delicate time in U.S. efforts to bring about talks between Israel and Palestinian representatives.
15 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The State Department said it had received a new letter on the subject from Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, restating Israel's previous objection to negotiating with any Palestinian tied to the PLO.
16 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Deciding what constitutes "terrorism" can be a legalistic exercise.
17 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The U.S. defines it as "premediated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine state agents." To meet the U.S. criteria, Israel contended it only listed incidents that involved civilians and occurred inside its pre-1967 borders.
18 <TAB> 19 <TAB> At the heart of Israel's report is a list of a dozen incidents Jerusalem attributes to Fatah, including the use of bombs and Molotov cocktails.
19 <TAB> 20 <TAB> But U.S. officials say they aren't satisfied these incidents constitute terrorism because they may be offshoots of the intifadah, the Palestinian rebellion in the occupied territories, which the U.S. doesn't classify as terrorism.
20 <TAB> 21 <TAB> In addition, the officials say Israel hasn't presented convincing evidence these acts were ordered by Fatah or by any group Mr. Arafat controls.
21 <TAB> 22 <TAB> U.S. terrorism experts also say they are highly uncertain about the veracity of the separate documents leaked to the New York Times.
22 <TAB> -1 <TAB> The papers, which Israel says were discovered in Israeli-occupied Gaza, refer to terrorist acts to be carried out in the name of a group called "the Revolutionary Eagles."
23 <TAB> -1 <TAB> Some supporters of Israel say U.S. policy on Palestinian terrorism is colored by an intense desire to maintain the dialogue with the PLO.
24 <TAB> -1 <TAB> But State Department officials accuse Israel of leaking questionable claims to embarrass the U.S.
